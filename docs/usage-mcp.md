# Pyserini: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

The Pyserini MCP server provides search and document retrieval capabilities through the Model Context Protocol, enabling AI assistants and other MCP clients to access Pyserini's information retrieval features.

## Getting Started

If you are running remotely and need to force the server to connect to your local, run this before you login to create a tunnel between the server and local 

When running mcp on remote with "streamable-http" it defaults to this link 127.0.0.1:8000, so we set our server to connect to this local

```bash
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 username@hostname
```

### Starting the MCP Server

The MCP server uses stdio transport and is designed to be launched by MCP clients. 
If you want to run the server manually, you will need the [development](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/installation.md#development-installation) installation of Pyserini. In your project root directory, run:

```bash
python -m pyserini.server.mcp
```

To use HTTP transport, you can use the CLI argument:
```bash
python -m pyserini.server.mcp --transport streamable-http
```

### Configuration for MCP Clients

Note that as of time of writing (June 2025), Claude Desktop only supports Windows and macOS, and remote MCP are in beta and only available with paid plans. 
Thus, if your Pyserini is on a remote Linux server like `orca`, you will want to look into other MCP clients that support remote MCP servers.
If you are using a remote MCP server, you will want to modify [`mcpyserini.py`](../pyserini/server/mcp/mcpyserini.py) to use HTTP to expose the server, and you can find more information about it [here](https://gofastmcp.com/deployment/running-server#streamable-http).

While unconventional, one working option is Cursor, and though it needs a paid subscription, students get one year free.
You can find more information about using it with MCP [here](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol). 

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

##### Running on STDIO

To use the Pyserini MCP server with Claude Desktop, go to `Claude->Settings->Developer` and click edit config.
This takes you to the Claude config file `claude_desktop_config.json`, where you can add the Pyserini MCP server configuration under the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpyserini": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/conda/env/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "python -m pyserini.server.mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes.
You should be able to see `mcpyserini` as an available tool in Claude.
To use mcpyserini, simply prompt Claude to use mcpyserini with a specific index and query.

For more details on configuring Claude Desktop, refer to the [Claude Desktop documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).



#### Running Remotely on HTTP

To use the Pyserini MCP server remotely with Claude Desktop, use this config file `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_pyserini": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/conda/env/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "path/to/your/pyserini_bridge.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
To download pyserini_bridge.py, run this: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/castorini/pyserini/main/pyserini/server/mcp/pyserini_bridge.py -O pyserini_bridge.py`

Add the path to this on your local to the `claude_desktop_config.json` file


#### Cursor Configuration

To use the Pyserini MCP server with Cursor, go to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` and add this to your cursor configuration file:


```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
      "mcpyserini": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
```

## Available Tools

The Pyserini MCP server provides two main tools for information retrieval:

### 1. Search Tool

**Tool Name:** `search`

**Description:** Perform a BM25 search on a given index and return top-k hits with document ID, score, and text snippet.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (string, required): Search query string
- `index_name` (string, required): Name of the index to search
- `k` (integer, optional): Number of results to return (default: 10)

**Returns:** List of search results, each containing:
- `docid`: Document identifier
- `score`: BM25 relevance score
- `contents`: Text snippet from the document
- `index_name`: Name of the index searched

**Example Usage in MCP Client:**

```
Search for "what is a lobster roll" in the msmarco-v1-passage index, returning 5 results.
```

### 2. Get Document Tool

**Tool Name:** `get_document`

**Description:** Retrieve the full text of a document by its document ID from a specified index.

**Parameters:**
- `docid` (string, required): Document ID to retrieve
- `index_name` (string, required): Name of the index containing the document

**Returns:** Document object containing:
- `docid`: Document identifier
- `contents`: Full document text
- `raw`: Raw document representation (if available)

**Example Usage in MCP Client:**

```
Retrieve the full text of document "7157715" from the msmarco-v1-passage index.
```
