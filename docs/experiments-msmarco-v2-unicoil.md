# Pyserini: uniCOIL w/ doc2query-T5 on MS MARCO V2

This guide describes how to reproduce retrieval experiments with the uniCOIL model on the MS MARCO V2 collections.
Details about our model can be found in the following paper:

[Document Expansions and Learned Sparse Lexical Representations for MS MARCO V1 and V2.](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/publications/Ma_etal_SIGIR2022.pdf) _Proceedings of the 45th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2022)_, July 2022.

Here, we start with versions of the MS MARCO V2 corpora that have already been processed with uniCOIL, i.e., we have applied model inference on every document and stored the output sparse vectors.

## Passage Ranking (No Expansion)

For the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track, we did not have time to train a new uniCOIL model on V2 data and we did not have time to finish doc2query-T5 expansions.
Thus, we applied uniCOIL without expansions in a zero-shot manner using a model trained on the MS MARCO V1 passage corpus.

To reproduce these runs directly from our pre-built indexes, see our [two-click reproduction matrix for MS MARCO V2 passage](https://castorini.github.io/pyserini/2cr/msmarco-v2-passage.html).
The passage ranking experiments here correspond to row (3a) for pre-encoded queries, and a corresponding condition for on-the-fly query inference.

To build the indexes from scratch, download the sparse representation of the corpus generated by uniCOIL:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco_v2_passage_unicoil_noexp_0shot.tar -P collections/
tar -xvf collections/msmarco_v2_passage_unicoil_noexp_0shot.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco_v2_passage_unicoil_noexp_0shot.tar` is 24 GB and has an MD5 checksum of `d9cc1ed3049746e68a2c91bf90e5212d`.

To index the sparse vectors:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonVectorCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco_v2_passage_unicoil_noexp_0shot/ \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot/ \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 32 \
  --impact --pretokenized
```

To perform retrieval:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot/ \
  --topics msmarco-v2-passage-dev \
  --encoder castorini/unicoil-noexp-msmarco-passage \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot.dev.txt \
  --batch 144 --threads 36 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

To evaluate, using `trec_eval`:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m recip_rank msmarco-v2-passage-dev \
    runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
map                   	all	0.1334
recip_rank            	all	0.1343

$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.100,1000 msmarco-v2-passage-dev \
    runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
recall_100            	all	0.4983
recall_1000           	all	0.7010
```

Note that we evaluate MAP and MRR at a cutoff of 100 hits to match the official evaluation metrics.
However, we measure recall at both 100 and 1000 hits; the latter is a common setting for reranking.

These results differ slightly from [the regressions in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot.md) because here we are performing on-the-fly query encoding, whereas the Anserini indexes use pre-encoded queries.
To reproduce the Anserini results, use pre-encoded queries with `--topics msmarco-v2-passage-dev-unicoil-noexp`.

## Passage Ranking (With doc2query-T5 Expansion)

After the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track submissions, we were able to complete doc2query-T5 expansions.

To reproduce these runs directly from our pre-built indexes, see our [two-click reproduction matrix for MS MARCO V2 passage](https://castorini.github.io/pyserini/2cr/msmarco-v2-passage.html).
The passage ranking experiments here correspond to row (3b) for pre-encoded queries, and a corresponding condition for on-the-fly query inference.

```

To confirm, `msmarco_v2_passage_unicoil_0shot.tar` is 41 GB and has an MD5 checksum of `1949a00bfd5e1f1a230a04bbc1f01539`.

  --output runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-0shot.dev.txt \
  --batch 144 --threads 36 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

To evaluate, using `trec_eval`:

```bash

    runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
map                     all     0.1488
recip_rank              all     0.1501

$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.100,1000 msmarco-v2-passage-dev \
    runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
recall_100              all     0.5515
recall_1000             all     0.7613
```

Note that we evaluate MAP and MRR at a cutoff of 100 hits to match the official evaluation metrics.
However, we measure recall at both 100 and 1000 hits; the latter is a common setting for reranking.

These results differ slightly from [the regressions in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-0shot.md) because here we are performing on-the-fly query encoding, whereas the Anserini indexes use pre-encoded queries.
To reproduce the Anserini results, use pre-encoded queries with `--topics msmarco-v2-passage-dev-unicoil`.

## Document Ranking (No Expansion)

For the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track, we did not have time to train a new uniCOIL model on V2 data and we did not have time to finish doc2query-T5 expansions.

```

To confirm, `msmarco_v2_doc_segmented_unicoil_noexp_0shot.tar` is 54 GB and has an MD5 checksum of `28261587d6afde56efd8df4f950e7fb4`.

  --batch 144 --threads 36 \
  --hits 10000 --max-passage --max-passage-hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

For the document corpus, since we are searching the segmented version, we retrieve the top 10k _segments_ and perform MaxP to obtain the top 1000 _documents_.

To evaluate, using `trec_eval`:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m recip_rank msmarco-v2-doc-dev \
    runs/run.msmarco-doc-v2-segmented-unicoil-noexp-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
map                   	all	0.2047
recip_rank            	all	0.2066

$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.100,1000 msmarco-v2-doc-dev \
    runs/run.msmarco-doc-v2-segmented-unicoil-noexp-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
recall_100            	all	0.7198
recall_1000           	all	0.8854
```

We evaluate MAP and MRR at a cutoff of 100 hits to match the official evaluation metrics.
However, we measure recall at both 100 and 1000 hits; the latter is a common setting for reranking.

These results differ slightly from [the regressions in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-msmarco-v2-doc-segmented-unicoil-noexp-0shot.md) because here we are performing on-the-fly query encoding, whereas the Anserini indexes use pre-encoded queries.
To reproduce the Anserini results, use pre-encoded queries with `--topics msmarco-v2-doc-dev-unicoil-noexp`.

## Document Ranking (With doc2query-T5 Expansion)

After the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track submissions, we were able to complete doc2query-T5 expansions.
Note that this experimental condition has been superseded by the one below, "title prepended".
When performing inference on the document segments, we originally did not prepend the title to provide context; later we realized that prepending the title was more effective.
However, we've kept this condition (without prepended title) around for completeness.

To build the indexes from scratch, download the sparse representation of the corpus generated by uniCOIL:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco_v2_doc_segmented_unicoil_0shot.tar -P collections/
tar -xvf collections/msmarco_v2_doc_segmented_unicoil_0shot.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco_v2_doc_segmented_unicoil_0shot.tar` is 62 GB and has an MD5 checksum of `889db095113cc4fe152382ccff73304a`.

To index the sparse vectors:

```bash

  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-doc-v2-segmented-unicoil-0shot/ \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 32 \
  --impact --pretokenized
```

To perform retrieval:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-doc-v2-segmented-unicoil-0shot/ \
  --topics msmarco-v2-doc-dev \
  --encoder castorini/unicoil-msmarco-passage \

  --batch 144 --threads 36 \
  --hits 10000 --max-passage --max-passage-hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

For the document corpus, since we are searching the segmented version, we retrieve the top 10k _segments_ and perform MaxP to obtain the top 1000 _documents_.

To evaluate, using `trec_eval`:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m recip_rank msmarco-v2-doc-dev \
    runs/run.msmarco-doc-v2-segmented-unicoil-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
map                     all     0.2217
recip_rank              all     0.2242

$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.100,1000 msmarco-v2-doc-dev \
    runs/run.msmarco-doc-v2-segmented-unicoil-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
recall_100              all     0.7556
recall_1000             all     0.9056
```

We evaluate MAP and MRR at a cutoff of 100 hits to match the official evaluation metrics.
However, we measure recall at both 100 and 1000 hits; the latter is a common setting for reranking.

These results differ slightly from [the regressions in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-msmarco-v2-doc-segmented-unicoil-0shot.md) because here we are performing on-the-fly query encoding, whereas the Anserini indexes use pre-encoded queries.
To reproduce the Anserini results, use pre-encoded queries with `--topics msmarco-v2-doc-dev-unicoil`.

## Document Ranking (With doc2query-T5 Expansion, Title Prepended)

After the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track submissions, we were able to complete doc2query-T5 expansions.
Note that when performing inference on the documents using the uniCOIL model here, we prepended the document title to provide context.
This is more effective than the condition described above (which does not have the title prepended); nevertheless, we have retained the above condition for completeness.

To reproduce these runs directly from our pre-built indexes, see our [two-click reproduction matrix for MS MARCO V2 doc](https://castorini.github.io/pyserini/2cr/msmarco-v2-doc.html).
The passage ranking experiments here correspond to row (3b) for pre-encoded queries, and a corresponding condition for on-the-fly query inference.
