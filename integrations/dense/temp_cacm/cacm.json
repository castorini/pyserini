The generation algorithm uses the information in the semantic network to select appropriate generation paths through the grammar. The system is designed for use as a computational tool that allows a linguist to develop and study methods for generating surface strings from an underlying semantic structure.

The central question addressed is: What might explain the differences between governments in the extent to which they adopt and use computers? Hypotheses are tested for several streams of explanatory factors, using data from more than 500 city and county governments. The findings identify certain local government milieus which are particularly conducive to higher levels of computer innovation. Somewhat unexpected findings reveal the significant impact of the distribution of control over EDP decisions and the dominant political values within the government.

This is accomplished by means of a mathematical model of a computer driven graphics system. The parameters of the model are functions of the capabilities of the graphics hardware and of the computational requirements of the graphics application.

{"id": "CACM-1470", "contents": "The Structure of Programming Languages The following are identified as major components of every programming language: (1) the elementary program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking elementary statements together, (3) the means by which a program can obtain data inputs. Several alternative forms of each of these components are described, compared and evaluated. Many examples, frequently from list processing languages, illustrate the forms described. Elementary program statements usually take the form of commands, requirements, or implicit specifications. A command is an imperative statement that commands the action to be taken. A requirement describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything about the actions to be taken. An implicit specification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer must understand what actions will be taken to achieve the desired effect. Subroutines may be entered explicitly, by execute call, or by function composition. Explicitly called subroutines generally require special linkage conventions. An execute subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from a basic instruction of the programming language. Function composition is a convenient alternative to the explicit call. The three principal ways of getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by a \"name\", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means of variables or functions. Names are useful entry points into permanent data structures, but can be error-causing distractions in other contexts. The author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors influencing the choice of a form of component for a language. He concludes by suggesting the evolution of programming languages toward one which will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring programs, organizing systems, and referencing data.

Each pair of words is then assigned a relative value that is a function of the total frequency in the data of each correspondence found in that pair of words. The output is a list of all correspondence types with their frequency of occurrence in the data, and a separate listing of each correspondence with all word-pairs showing that correspondence (unless their relative value is below an arbitrarily chosen cutoff point). The article explains the usefulness, as well as the limitations, of the programs, and illustrates its use with a small portion of hypothetical data. CACM June, 1970 Frantz, D.

{"id": "CACM-2856", "contents": "The Synthetic Approach to Decision Table Conversion Previous approaches to the problem of automatically converting decision tables to computer programs have been based on decomposition. At any stage, one condition is selected for testing, and two smaller problems (decision tables with one less condition) are created. An optimal program (with respect to average execution time or storage space, for example) is located only through implicit enumeration of all possible decision trees using a technique such as branch-and-bound. The new approach described in this paper uses dynamic programming to synthesize an optimal decision tree from which a program can be created. Using this approach, the efficiency of creating an optimal program is increased substantially, permitting generation of optimal programs for decision tables with as many as ten to twelve conditions.

This introduction gives a review of the current state of the art in these systems and discusses the differences and similarities between capabilities found in host language systems and those found in self-contained systems. After some discussion of the problems of data independence and binding,the four user levels are identified and described. Technical problems facing future designers are described. The first of these is that of handling existing stored data and the next is that of providing more complex data structures than those already available in conventional programming languages. The problem of high level interrogation and update functions acting on network structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the problem of catering to a high volume of transactions initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest level of user. The use of Cobol as a basis for further development work is considered at some length with respect to data structures, host language capabilities, and self-contained capabilities. This section also assesses the effect of the Data Base Task Group proposals. The final section outlines the ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

{"id": "CACM-1497", "contents": "On the Normalization Requirement of Divisor in Divide- and- Correct Methods This paper presents an analysis on the normalization requirement of the divisor in a divide-and-correct method. This analysis is made subject to the condition that not more than one correction is required to obtain the true quotient character, from the trial estimate got from the division of a two-precision segment of every partial remainder by a suitably rounded single-precision divisor. (This segmented division is denoted here as a (2, 1) precision basic division.) It is found that the normalization requirement could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors, provided the magnitude of the character next to the leading character of the divisor is known. If, however, the normalization is to be eliminated one has to choose proper higher precision segments of operands for the basic division. Also considered is the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an increase on the number of corrections on the quotient estimate got from a (2, 1) precision basic division. It is shown that such a scheme is economical only for small radices. CACM December, 1967 Krishnamurthy, E. V. Nandi, S. K.

It describes the synergistic effect that the freedom to move and alter features from one of these domains to another has had on the design of this system (which has not been implemented). This freedom simplified both incremental compilation and the system's addressing structure, and centralized the communication mechanisms enabling the construction of hierarchical subsystems. It also suggested an important new concept for operating systems: separation of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resource allocation. This separation enables incorporation of new scheduling algorithms (decision of what to do) without endangering the system integration (correctly performing the scheduling decisions).

For large capacities the effect on the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred while filling the first-level store can be significant, even for long reference strings. Use of \"warm-start\" rather than \"cold-start\" miss ratios cast doubt on the widespread belief that the observed \"S-shape\" of lifetime (reciprocal of miss ratio) versus capacity curve indicates a property of behavior of programs that maintain a constant number of pages in main storage. On the other hand, if cold-start miss ratios are measured as a function of capacity and measurement length, then they are useful in studying systems in which operation of a program is periodically interrupted by task switches. It is shown how to obtain, under simple assumptions, the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming from cold-start miss ratio values and how to obtain approximate cold-start miss ratios from warm-start miss ratios.

The paper presents the conceptual view of graphics leading to the design of SEMBEGS and outlines the major components of the system. The design of SEMBEGS is founded upon the basic assumption that the true aim of computer graphics is to describe graphical entities, rather than, as commonly held, to provide graphical input and output functional capabilities. SEMBEGS is built around a Basic Graphical Data Management System (BAGDAMS) which provides a common means of communicating the descriptions of graphical entities between the various components of SEMBEGS. BAGDAMS provides facilities for storing, retrieving, and manipulating the descriptions of graphical entities provided by, and received by application programs, graphics packages, and graphical devices.

Both kinds of processing draw upon a common store of data contained in the direct access central file.

{"id": "CACM-1727", "contents": "One Way of Estimating Frequencies of Jumps in a Program For the segmentation of a program it is useful to have a reasonable estimation of the values of S(ij), where S(ij) is the mean value of the number of jumps from the i-th instruction on to the j-th instruction in the run time. In the cases where the S(ij) are estimated directly, the structure of the whole program must be generally taken into account; therefore it is very difficult for the programmer and/or the translator to obtain a good estimation of the S(ij). It is easier to estimate not S(ij) but the quantities P(ij)=S(ij)*C(i)/SUM[S(ij), j=1,N], where C(i) is an arbitrary positive constant for each i. Although the P(ij) are, for each i, proportional to S(ij), the estimation of P(ij) is easier, because we must estimate only the \"probabilities\" of events where instruction i is executed after instruction I(i). This estimation can often be done without considering the structure of the whole program. In the first part of the paper, using the theory of the Markov chains, an algorithm for the computation of the S(ij) from the P(ij) is found, and some ways of obtaining estimates of the P(ij) are given. In the second part a variant of this algorithm is derived, avoiding the necessity of computation involving large matrices.

{"id": "CACM-1856", "contents": "The Teachable Language Comprehender: A Simulation Program and Theory of Language The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to \"comprehend\" English text. When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory. This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing factual assertions about the world. The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text. By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory. In this form it can be added into the memory. Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed. TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided. Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind. The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future.

Such a compiler translates the parsed source code into lower level code by a sequence of steps. Each step expands higher level statements into blocks of lower level code and then performs optimizations on the result. Each statement has only one possible expansion-the task of tailoring this code to take advantage of any special cases is done by the optimizations. This paper provides evidence that this strategy can indeed result in good object code. The traditionally difficult PL/I concatenate statement was investigated as a detailed example. A set of fairly simple optimizations was identified which allow the compiler to produce good code. More elaborate optimizations can further improve the object code. For most contexts of the concatenate statement, the code produced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization strategy described above compares favorably with the code produced by a conventional PL/I optimizing compiler.

Automatic navigation using visible light or radar images requires exact alignment of such images with digital terrain models. In addition, automatic classification of terrain, using satellite imagery, requires such alignment to deal correctly with the effects of varying sun angle and surface slope. Even inspection techniques for certain industrial parts may be improved by this means. We achieve the required alignment by matching the real image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources. The synthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection as a function of surface gradient. We illustrate the technique using LANDSAT images and digital terrain models. CACM November, 1978 Horn, B. Bachman, B.

Using this analysis, methods with the same overall performance can be classified and key distributions partial to certain transformations can be identified. All this can be done analytically.

{"id": "CACM-1525", "contents": "On Computing The Fast Fourier Transform Cooley and Tukey have proposed a fast algorithm for computing complex Fourier transform and have shown major time savings in using it to compute large transforms on a digital computer. With n a power of two, computing time for this algorithm is proportional to n log2 n, a major improvement over other methods with computing time proportional to n^2. In this paper, the fast Fourier transform algorithm is briefly reviewed and fast difference equation methods for accurately computing the needed trigonometric function values are given. The problem of computing a large Fourier transform on a system with virtual memory is considered, and a solution is proposed. This method has been used to compute complex Fourier transforms of size n = 2^16 on a computer with 2^15 words of core storage; this exceeds by a factor of eight the maximum radix two transform size with fixed allocation of this amount of core storage. The method has also been used to compute large mixed radix transforms. A scaling plan for computing the fast Fourier transform with fixed-point arithmetic is also given.

The notion of reduction class for a context-free grammar is then introduced and its connection with the structure of a bounded-context parser is indicated. Next, pushdown automata which generate the different reduction classes of a context-free grammar are defined. Finally, the algorithm is described; it essentially carries out an exhaustive study of all possible runs of the pushdown automata generating the reduction classes.

Use of the system requires a minimum of experience or instruction, since the growth of an overlaying system control language has been prevented, and there are no processor-oriented statements, like variable type or dimension declarations. Moreover, in the online situation the processor interacts with the graphical keyboard on a character-by-character basis so as to restrict the programmer's choice of input symbols to those which are syntactically correct.

This paper presents a set of mutually consistent philosophies regarding code extension applications, and suggests a corollary set of doctrines for the application of the code extension characters. Distinctions are drawn between code extension and such other concepts as \"graphic substitution\" or \"syntactic representation\" which are often used to meet similar requirements.

{"id": "CACM-1003", "contents": "A Computer Analysis Method For Thermal Diffusion in Biochemical Systems In the thermal detection of rapid biochemical reactions it is necessary to correct the temperature data for transient heat conduction losses in a cylindrical calorimeter. To handle the complexities arising from varying thermal-relaxation times of concentric insulating layers, a computer program was developed which gives the temperature distribution of the system as a function of radius and time. This distribution is corrected at each step by a subroutine which calculates the instantaneous chemical state of there action, as well as the heat produced by this reaction. The program is based on a direct statement of Fourier's law of heat conduction and the chemical rate equation to provide a \"bookkeeping law\" to follow the reactants and the flow of heat packets, in such a way that the computer continually stores the heat distribution. A computer analysis method is here regarded as one in which the physical laws of a process are used explicitly in the program. Usually this results in by passing much of the mathematical procedures conventionally used. The program was tested against some known exact solutions of the heat equation and gave identical results, and compared well with experimental data of a known biochemical reaction. The construction of computer programs based on the direct statement of the physical laws is a principle of general applicability which has been applied to several other physical phenomena.

There is a great deal of theoretical interest in Algol 68 and in extensible languages, but so far at least they have had little practical impact. Problem-oriented languages may very well become the most important language development area in the next five to ten years. In the operating system area all major computer manufacturers set out to produce very ambitious multiprogramming systems, and they all ran into similar problems. A number of university projects,though not directly comparable to those of the manufacturers, have contributed greatly to a better understanding of operating system principles. Important trends include the increased interest in the development of system measurement and evaluation techniques,and increased use of microprogramming for some programming system functions.

The processes of encoding and error detection are based upon parity evaluations along prescribed dimensions of the array. Effectiveness of the codes is increased by introducing a \"system check bit\", which is essentially a parity check on the other parity bits. Only three-dimensional codes are discussed in this paper with parity evaluations along the horizontal, the vertical, and one main diagonal. However, the family of codes is not restricted to three dimensions, as evidenced by the discussion by Minnick and Ashenhurst on a similar multidimensional single-bit selection plan used for another purpose [6]. A four-dimensional code, correcting three and detecting four errors, has been developed; the extension to higher-dimensional codes with greater correction power is straightforward.

Applications of disk usage are discussed separately for problem programs and for systems programs such as compilers and the supervisory program. Approximately 260,000 words of disk storage are reserved for the storage of systems programs and the subroutine library. Problem programs, however, are not currently filed on the disk. Certain programming techniques are discussed for transmitting words between disk and core storage with minimum delaying and interruption of the arithmetic unit. Dumps on disk are considered for both recovery from computer malfunction and for mathematical or physical developments during the calculation. Some comments are made regarding the reliability, economics, utility and weaknesses or limitations of the disk system.

The first, of primarily theoretical interest, shows that without cell tag bits the task can be performed in time n^2.

Any noncyclic structure is copied in linear speed, while cyclic structures are copied in average time less than nlogn. No foreknowledge of cycle absence is necessary to achieve linear speed. A variation of the second algorithm solves an open problem concerning list structure marking.

The notions of process and state vector are discussed, and the nature of basic operations on processes is considered. Some of the connections between processes and protection are analyzed. A very general approach to priority-oriented scheduling is described, and its relationship to conventional interrupt systems is explained. Some aspects of time-oriented scheduling are considered. The implementation of the scheduling mechanism is analyzed in detail and the feasibility of embodying it in hardware established.

This surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, is constructed by separately determining an optimal surface between each pair of consecutive contours. Determining such a surface is reduced to the problem of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed toroidal graph. A new fast algorithm for finding such cycles is utilized. Also developed is a closed-form expression, in term of the number of contour poin ts, for an upper bound on the number of operations required to execute the algorithm.

While it would be desirable to obtain an optimal solution to this allocation problem, it is clear that the number of parameters involved makes it intractable to straight-forward solution. In such a situation, we must find a set of assumptions which simplify the problem greatly, but which still provide a basis for considering all significant cost elements. This paper presents such a first, quantitative allocation step. It considers many of the significant detailed costs of system utilization, data storage, data staging, and data migration. Although many avenues of further improvement are available, the present algorithm seems to be usefully accurate. As such, it can aid in quantifying the problems of data set allocation, storage system configuration, and new device designs. CACM June, 1975 Lum, V. Y. Senko, M. E Wang, C. P.

{"id": "CACM-2692", "contents": "Reentrant Polygon Clipping A new family of clipping algorithms is described. These algorithms are able to clip polygons against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in three dimensions, removing the parts of the polygon which lie outside the volume. In two dimensions the algorithms permit clipping against irregular convex windows. Polygons to be clipped are represented as an ordered sequence of vertices without repetition of first and last, in marked contrast to representation as a collection of edges as was heretofore the common procedure. Output polygons have an identical format, with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe any newly-cut edge or edges. The algorithms easily handle the particularly difficult problem of detecting that a new vertex may be required at a corner of the clipping window. The algorithms described achieve considerable simplicity by clipping separately against each clipping plane or window boundary. Code capable of clipping the polygon against a single boundary is reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries. Each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only two vertex values and may begin its processing as soon as the first output vertex from the proceeding stage is ready. Because the same code is reentered for clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping against very complex window shapes is practical. For perspective applications in three dimentions, a six-plane truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping volume. The two additional planes parallel to the projection screen serve to limit the range of depth preserved through the projection. A perspective projection method which provides for arbitrary view angles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clipping planes is described. This method is ideal for subsequent hidden-surface computations. CACM January, 1974 Sutherland, I. E. Hodgman, G.

The system described is hardware-independent and has been implemented on a variety of installations, of different manufacturers, having diverse configurations. The elements common to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in which these elements may be combined into a system based on simple modules is demonstrated. These modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis systems or other attributes of the plot. This enables plots of any complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules. The basic syntax of AMESPLOT is outlined, and a brief description is given of its current utility software, consisting of \"macros\" to produce self-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots, map coastlines, and 3-D plots. The system was formulate d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information, and it should be fully integrable with user's program written in most conventional higher languages. The functions of positioning, locating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of axes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise. The structuring of plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is described. Transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible. The user may interact freely with AMESPLOT at three levels, enabling him to construct his own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and to produce a variety of artistic and other effects.

Cobol was studied because of economic importance, widespread usage, possible error-including design, and lack of research. The types of errors were identified in a pilot study; then, using the 132 error types found, 1,777 errors were classified in 1,4000 runs of 73 Cobol students. Error density was high: 20 percent of the types contained 80 percent of the total frequency, which implies high potential effectiveness for software based correction of Cobol. Surprisingly, only four high-frequency errors were error-prone, which implies minimal error inducing design. 80 percent of Cobol misspellings were classifiable in the four error categories of previous researchers, which implies that Cobol misspellings are correctable by existent algorithms. Reserved word usage was not error-prone, which implies minimal interference with usage of reserved words. Over 80 percent of error diagnosis was found to be inaccurate.

{"id": "CACM-1936", "contents": "Variable Length Tree Structures Having Minimum Average Search Time Sussenguth suggests in a paper (1963) that a file should be organized as a doubly-chained tree structure if it is necessary both to search and to update frequently. Such a structure provides a compromise between the fast search/slow update characteristics of binary searching and the slow search/fast update characteristics of serial searching. His method, however, contains the limiting restriction that all terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree. This paper considers the effect of relaxing this restriction. First, trees which have the property that a priori the filial set of each node is well defined are studied. It is proved that coding the nodes within each filial set with respect to the number of terminal nodes reachable from each is necessary and sufficient to guarantee minimum average search time. Then the more general case (that is, where the entire structure of the tree is changeable) is treated. A procedure is developed for constructing a tree with a minimum average search time. A simple closed expression for this minimum average search time is obtained as a function of the number of terminal nodes. The storage capacity required to implement the doubly-chained tree structure on a digital computer is also determined. Finally, the total cost of the structure, using Sussenguth's cost criterion, is computed. It is shown that significant improvements in both the average search time and the total cost can be obtained by relaxing Sussenguth's restriction that all terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree.

A second example then describes how using the most frequently entered state as the regenerative state reduces the chance of making a costly error in a preliminary simulation run.

Transfers between the core and drum stores and to and from the twin paper-tape input and output channels are all available autonomously (concurrently, time-shared). Multiplication and division orders are also autonomous, so that the machine may be executing up to three orders simultaneously. All functions naturally are interlocked. A number of other advanced orders and facilities are also incorporatedn particular, an \"Execute\" order permits a temporary jump for up to four orders and a second modifier register permits double modification in general and relative addressing of subroutines in particular.

The weighted buddy method allows block sizes of 2^k and 3(2^k), whereas the original buddy method allowed only block sizes of 2^k. This extension is achieved at an additional cost of only two bits per block. Simulation results are presented which compare this method with the buddy method. These results indicate that for a uniform request distribution, the buddy system has less total memory fragmentation than the weighted buddy algorithm.

The high cost of these cosine transformations has been a serious drawback in using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. Two other problems related to the cosine transformation have also been trouble some. First, the conventional computation of the cosine transformation by recurrence relation is numerically unstable, particularly at the low frequencies which have the largest effect upon the integral. Second, in case the automatic scheme should require refinement of the sampling, storage is required to save the integrand values after the cosine transformation is computed. This second part of the paper shows how the cosine transformation can be computed by a modification of the fast Fourier transform and all three problems overcome. The modification is also applicable in other circumstances requiring cosine or sine transformations, such as polynomial interpolation through the Chebyshev points. CACM May, 1972 Gentleman, W.

The properties of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing the given figure of merit. This problem can be represented as a shortest path problem on a graph and can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms. The relations between this representation of the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach are discussed, showing that the graph search method can lead to substantial improvements in computing time. Moreover, if heuristic search methods are used, the computing time will depend on the amount of noise in the picture. Some experimental results are given; these show how various information about the shape of the contour of an object can be embedded in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction of contours from noisy picture and the separation of touching objects.

Both take into account rule frequencies and the time needed to test conditions. One of the algorithms, called the optimum-finding algorithm, leads to a flowchart which truly minimizes execution time for a decision table in which simple rules are already contracted to complex rules. The other one, called the optimum-approaching algorithm, requires many fewer calculations but does not necessarily produce the optimum flowchart. The algorithms are first derived for treating decision tables not containing an ELSE-rule, but the optimum-approaching algorithm is shown to be equally valid for tables including such a rule. Both algorithms are compared with existing ones and are applied to a somewhat large decision table derived from a real case. From this comparison two conclusions are drawn. (1) The optimum-approaching algorithm will usually lead to better results than comparable existing ones and will not require more, but usually less, computation time.(2) In general, the greater computation effort needed for applying the optimum-finding algorithm will not be justified by the small reduction in execution time obtained.

This study investigates the use of an unconventional method of treating overflow records. The method is to use hashing techniques to allocate space for such records. If certain conditions are satisfied, this is superior to the conventional ISAM method of chaining the overflow records via linked list techniques. These conditions are: long overflow chains with significant overflow; lack of tight disk space constraints; record keys which are small compared to the total record size; and significant use of the file in the index as opposed to the sequential mode.

Attention is given to the amount of memory resource required for effective processing of the I/O activity (buffer space assignment). The model studies used both distribution-driven and trace-driven techniques. Even relatively simple dynamic schedulers are shown to improve system performance (as measured by user CPU time) over that given by optimal or near-optimal static schedulers imbeded in identical system structures and workload environments.

A primer or informal description of the language is followed by examples, a description of experiments with the language on an IBM 704 computer, and a formal description which, taken with the ALGOL 60 Report, defines the proposed string language.

The process of locating the desired responses can be represented by a tree search model. This paper poses an optimization problem in the design of such trees to serve a well-specified application. The problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical techniques. On the other hand, it is potentially useful for the comparison it affords between observed performance and that of an intuitively attractive ideal search procedure. As a practical application of such a model this paper considers the design of a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation of data and shows that essentially the same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal search tree or a bit-vector tree.

The algorithm transforms the obstacles so that they represent the locus of forbidden positions for an arbitrary reference point on the moving object. A trajectory of this reference point which avoids all forbidden regions is free of collisions. Trajectories are found by searching a network which indicates, for each vertex in the transformed obstacles, which other vertices can be reached safely. CACM October, 1979 Lozano-Perez, T. Wesley, M.

The number of nodes of a Pk tree asymptotically grows as a power of the height, in the worst case. A procedure for node insertion is given, and the class of trees considered is restricted to IPk trees, which are buildable by such a procedure. The average behavior of such trees, studied by an extensive set of simulation runs, is close to that of AVL trees. In particular, the family of IPO trees whose main advantage is the reduced number of restructurings required after node insertion, is analyzed. CACM November, 1978 Luccio, F. Pagli, L.

{"id": "CACM-2620", "contents": "Execution Time Requirements for Encipherment Programs Although encipherment has often been discussed as a means to protect computer data, its costs are not well established. Five experiments were conducted to measure the cpu time on a CDC 6400 required by additive ciphers programmed both in assembly language and in Fortran: a \"null transformation\" to measure the time to move data without encipherment; encipherment with one-word key; encipherment with a 125-word key; double key encipherment; and encipherment using a pseudo random key. The results were analyzed for consistency over 100 runs, and the effects of constant and intermittent errors were considered. Timing rates for assembly language encipherment ranged from 498,800 characters per second for a pseudo random key cipher to 2,092,000 characters per second for a constant one-word key cipher. The latter is almost equivalent to the rate required simply to move data without encipherment. Fortran tests required over four times as much cpu time. This paper introduces the idea on enciphering time coefficient the ratio of enciphering time to the time taken to fetch and store data without encipherment. CACM August, 1974 Friedman, T.

{"id": "CACM-2568", "contents": "A Graph Formulation of a School Scheduling Algorithm The problem classically titled \"The Examination Schedule Problem\" takes various forms in the literature. Most of these formulations can be presented in the terminology of classical Network Theory. One such formulation is: Given a nondirected network, partition its nodes into a minimal number of subsets such that no two members of the same subset are connected by anarc. An obvious lower limit to this number is the size of the largest strongly connected subgraph. Kirchgassner proved that an upper limit is this size plus one. One logical extension of the previous work is the introduction of variable length examinations where W(I) is the number of periods for exam I. The object of this paper is to generalize the definition of largest strongly connected subgraph to include the weighting of nodes, to present an approximate algorithm which usually finds the largest strongly connected subgraph, and to discuss the application of this algorithm to the solution of school scheduling and exam scheduling problems.

For each statistic, the algorithm included the usual computing formulas, correction due to an accumulated error term, and a recursive computation of the current value of the statistic. The usual computing formulas were also evaluated in double precision. Large errors were noted for some calculation using the usual computing formulas. The most reliable technique was correction of the initial estimate by use of an accumulated error term. To eliminate the need for making two passes on the data, it was suggested that the initial estimate of the mean be obtained from a subset of the data. CACM July, 1966 Neely, P. M.

{"id": "CACM-2905", "contents": "Perfect Hashing Functions: A Single Probe Retrieving Method for Static Sets A refinement of hashing which allows retrieval of an item in a static table with a single probe is considered. Given a set I of identifiers, two methods are presented for building, in a mechanical way, perfect hashing functions, i.e. functions transforming the elements of I into unique addresses. The first method, the \"quotient reduction\" method, is shown to be complete in the sense that for every set I the smallest table in which the elements of I can be stored and from which they can be retrieved by using a perfect hashing function constructed by this method can be found. However, for nonuniformly distributed sets, this method can give rather sparse tables. The second method, the \"remainder reduction\" method, is not complete in the above sense, but it seems to give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for every kind of set. The two techniques are applicable directly to small sets. Some methods to extend these results to larger sets are also presented. A rough comparison with ordinary hashing is given which shows that this method can be used conveniently in several practical applications.

{"id": "CACM-2923", "contents": "High-Level Data Flow Analysis In contrast to the predominant use of low-level in termediate text, high-level data flow analysis deals with programs essentially at source level and exploits the control flow information implicit in the parse tree. The need for high-level flow analysis arises from several aspects of recent work on advanced methods of program certification and optimization. This paper proposes a simple general method of high-level data flow analysis that allows free use of escape and jump statements, avoids large graphs when compiling large programs, facilitates updating of data flow information to reflect program changes, and derives new global information helpful in solving many familiar global flow analysis problems. An illustrative application to live variable analysis is presented. Many of the graphs involved are constructed and analyzed before any programs are compiled, thus avoiding certain costs that low-level methods incur repeatedly at compile time.

{"id": "CACM-1488", "contents": "Programming Decision Tables in FORTRAN, COBOL or ALGOL A simple broad-based approach for programming decision tables in FORTRAN or COBOL is developed and presented. With inputs in standard form, as defined in the paper, the programming of any decision table can be done with one or two FORTRAN statements, or with two COBOL statements, if the COMPUTE verb is available in the COBOL processor. It is shown that the method is applicable even when there are more than two mutually exclusive states of one, two or more table conditions. It is further shown that multi-state conditions in decision tables can often simplify the programming. The method outlined has the further advantage that all possible combinations of conditions are considered. It is shown that the suggested procedure is easily implemented in ALGOL.

This is done by solving a more general problem, i.e. the elimination of computations performed twice on a given execution path. Such computations are termed partially redundant. Moreover, the algorithm does not require any graphical information or restrictions on the shape of the program graph. Testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly linear with the size of the program, and that it leads to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time.

It is intended to serve as a basis for the construction of operating systems, which are prime examples of programs with concurrent activities. The scheme includes a set of basic instructions for the generation, termination, and synchronization of parallel processes.

{"id": "CACM-2911", "contents": "Anomalous Behavior of the Fifty-Percent Rule in Dynamic Memory Allocation This paper reports simulation data showing that, in dynamic memory allocation, the average free-to-allocated-block ratio can differ considerably and in both directions from the predictions of the 50 percent rule. A new derivation is given, and it is shown that previous derivations make an assumption that may be violated frequently. On the basis of the simulation data and the derivation, it is hypothesized that the anomalous behavior results from the combined effects of systematic placement and the statistics of the release process. Additional simulations support this hypothesis. Systematic placement, which refers to the natural convention of always allocating storage requests against the same end of the free block selected by the allocation strategy, tends to order blocks within contiguous groups according to their allocation time. The degree of anomalous behavior depends on the extent to which allocated blocks are released in the order of their allocation. For non-Markovian release processes, the extent of the correlation between allocation order and release order varies approximately inversely with the coefficient of variation of the memory residence time distribution. The simulations show that allocation efficiency depends strongly on the residence time distribution; efficiency decreases as the distribution's coefficient of variation increases. Some practical implications are briefly discussed. CACM November, 1977 Shore, J.

The inadequacies of these schemes when dealing with shared addresses are explained. These inadequacies are traced to the lack of an efficient absolute address for objects in these systems. The direct use of a capability as an address is shown to overcome these difficulties because it provides the needed absolute address. Implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed. It is predicted that the use of tags to identify capabilities will dominate. A hardware address translation scheme which never requires the modification of the representation of capabilities is suggested. The scheme uses a main memory hash table for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given its unique code. The hash table is avoided for recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative registers. A computer using capability-based addressing may be substantially superior to present systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of programming conventions, and efficient implementation.

With a given computer M is associated a fictitious computer M' essentially identical to M except in respect to possession of unbounded primary storage.

A program sequence P for M' is termed M-admissible (relative to a specific execution time period) if there is a mapping underwhich P and its effective data referents are all located in the direct address set of M. Storage allocation is considered as a process of establishing for an arbitrary M' program a sequence of mappings, a decoupling of the program into M-admissible subprograms and a linking set of interludes. An existence proof in terms of a completely interpretive M program as indicated. Some special cases are discussed.

The solution to the integral equation indicates that using more advanced algorithms in the family makes only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort, but substantially reduces the variance in sorting effort. Statistical tests of the values of several thousand trees containing up to 10,000 points have given first, second, and third moments of the value distribution function in satisfactory agreement with the moments computed from the generating function.

The approximation algorithm presented operates on such an organization, eliminating the need for the recognition of region boundaries. Each segment is examined only once. The versatility of the new organization is further illustrated by the outline of algorithms for area computation and point inclusion.

This approach, the intermittent-assertion method, involves documenting the program with assertions that must be true at some time when control passes through the corresponding point, but that need not be true every time. The method, introduced by Burstall, promises to provide a valuable complement to the more conventional methods. The intermittent-assertion method is presented with a number of examples of correctness and termination proofs. Some of these proofs are markedly simpler than their conventional counterparts. On the other hand, it is shown that a proof of correctness or termination by any of the conventional techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof using intermittent assertions. Finally, it is shown how the intermittent-assertion method can be applied to prove the validity of program transformations and the correctness of continuously operating programs.

Although this picture is of value to the analyst, the elements of an n-dimensional array must exist in conventional storage as a linear array or vector. The means of performing the transformation of a set of indices locating on array element in n-space to the location (address) of the element in its storage vector is the subject of this paper. It is noted that the index address transformation is computationally identical to the conversion of a number from a fixed to a mixed radix number system.

The origin and evolution of the hardware, operating system, and languages are described in terms of technological change, user requirements, and user developments. The PDP-10's contributions to computing technology include: accelerating the transition from batch oriented to time sharing computing systems; transferring hardware technology within DEC (and elsewhere) to minicomputer design and manufacturing; supporting minicomputer hardware and software development; and serving as a model for single user and timeshared interactive minicomputer/microcomputer systems.

It is concluded that at least minimally effective techniques have been devised for answering questions from natural language subsets in small scale experimental systems and that a useful paradigm has evolved to guide research efforts in the field. Current approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects of meaning or to applications over large subsets of English. Generalizing from current small-scale experiments to language-processing systems based on dictionaries with thousands of entries-with correspondingly large grammars and semantic systems-may entail a new order of complexity and require the invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis and questions answering.

{"id": "CACM-1946", "contents": "Computing Polynomial Resultants: Bezout's Determinant vs. Collins' Reduced P. Algorithm Algorithms for computing the resultant of two polynomials in several variables, a key repetitive step of computation in solving systems of polynomial equations by elimination, are studied. Determining the best algorithm for computer implementation depends upon the extent to which extraneous factors are introduced, the extent of propagation of errors caused by truncation of real coefficients, memory requirements, and computing speed. Preliminary considerations narrow the choice of the best algorithm to Bezout's determinant and Collins' reduced polynomial remainder sequence (p.r.s.) algorithm. Detailed tests performed on sample problems conclusively show that Bezout's determinant is superior in all respects except for univariate polynomials, in which case Collins' reduced p.r.s. algorithm is somewhat faster. In particular Bezout's determinant proves to be strikingly superior in numerical accuracy, displaying excellent stability with regard to round-off errors. Results of tests are reported in detail.

{"id": "CACM-2046", "contents": "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Change in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed.

Generations of cryptanalysts have expended untold man-years, thus far without success, attempting tode code them; vast armies of fortune hunters and treasure seekers have devoted Herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills of Virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza. The history of pertinent activities would fill volumes, yet serious students of cryptography have always had nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity. It has been alleged that the \"known solution\" to Cypher Number Two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49,...(\"I have deposited in the County of Bedford about four miles from Buford's in an excavation or vault...\") with the aid of an unsanitized version of the Declaration of Independence was merely a superb, imaginative, and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago for whatever reasons. Modern computer technology could obviously perform signature analyses the process of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper insights into their construction. For the benefit of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the second cypher employs a specified document whose words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of the clear text or message. The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches is then written down as the final code. While primitive, the process has the advantage of relative security until the source document becomes known; at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second graders. The work now completed with the help of our UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies of the Beale cyphers and various types of simulations. For example, we have turned the entire process of simulated encoding by various schemes over to the machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic codes; we have also encoded various messages by hand, using different texts and a variety of methods to obtain their signatures. These simulations provide convincing evidence that the signatures are both process and data dependent; they indicate also very strongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that it is merely a matter of time before someone finds the correct source document and locates the right vault in the common-wealth of Virginia.

Since assignment, CALL, RETURN, and IF statements together account for 93 percent of all executable statements, special care is given to ensure that these statements can be implemented efficiently. A highly compact instruction encoding scheme is presented, which can reduce program size by a factor of 3. Unlike a Huffman code, which utilizes variable length fields, this method uses only fixed length (1-byte) op code and address fields. The most frequent instructions consist of a single 1-byte field. As a consequence, instruction decoding time is minimized, and the machine is efficient with respect to both space and time.

{"id": "CACM-2753", "contents": "A Heuristic Problem Solving Design System for Equipment or Furniture Layouts The Designer Problem Solver (DPS) demonstrates that the computer can perform simple design tasks. In particular, it designs furniture and equipment layouts. This task was chosen because it is simple, well defined, and characteristic of many design tasks in architecture, engineering, urban planning, and natural resource management. These space planning tasks usually involve manipulating two-dimensional representations of objects to create feasible or optimal solutions for problems involving topological and metric spatial constraints. The paper describes extensive tests performed on the program. DPS is a heuristic problem solver with a planning phase prefixed to it. It uses the planning process to give it a sense of direction, diagnostic procedures to locate difficulties, and remedial actions to recover from difficulties. It uses a convex polygon representation to accurately describe the objects and the layout. This representation allows topological and metric constraints to be tested and the design to be easily updated. DPS has been applied to 50 problems. While it is slow and limited in scope, the ideas behind it are general. It demonstrates the need for selectivity in controlling search and the methods used to achieve it: task-specific information, planning, diagnostic procedures, remedial actions, and selective alternative generators.

This system is intended for a wide variety of biomedical applications. As an example, the methods are applied to the karyotyping of chromosomes. The system is separated into four programming tasks: picture transformations, file maintenance, picture structuring, and display management. Picture structuring is considered as the vehicle for man-machine communication. A prototype data format for pictures, called a picture-form, is developed. Structure operators are defined which manipulate picture-forms to produce new pictures-forms. Many of the ideas are taken from the symbolic mathematical laboratory at MIT conceived by Marvin Minsky.

A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events. The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become. CACM July, 1978 Lamport, L.

{"id": "CACM-2053", "contents": "On the Conversion of Decision Tables to Computer Programs The use of execution time diagnostics in pinpointing ambiguities in decision tables is discussed. It is pointed out that any attempt at resolving ambiguities at compile time will, in general, be impossible. It is shown that, as a consequence, tree methods of converting decision tables to programs are inadequate in regard to ambiguity detection. Two algorithms for programming decision tables whose merits are simplicity of implementation and detection of ambiguities at execution time are presented. The first algorithm is for limited entry decision tables and clarifies the importance of proper coding of the information in the decision table. The second algorithm programs a mixed entry decision table directly without going through the intermediate step of conversion to a limited entry form, thereby resulting in storage economy. A comparison of the algorithms and others proposed in the literature is made. Some features of a decision table to Fortran IV translator for the IBM 7044 developed by the authors are given.

{"id": "CACM-1491", "contents": "EULER: A Generalization ALGOL, and its Formal Definition: Part I* A method for defining programming languages is developed which introduces a rigorous relationship between structure and meaning. The structure of a language is defined by a phrase structure syntax, the meaning in terms of the effects which the execution of a sequence of interpretation rules exerts upon a fixed set of variables, called the Environment. There exists a one-to-one correspondence between syntactic rules and interpretation rules is determined by the sequence of corresponding syntactic reductions which constitute a parse. The individual interpretation rules are explained in terms of an elementary an d obvious algorithmic notation. A constructive method for evaluating a text is provided, and for certain decidable classes of languages their unambiguity is proved. As an example, a generalization of ALGOL is described in full detail to demonstrate that concepts like block-structure, procedures, parameters, etc. can be defined adequately and precisely by this method.

{"id": "CACM-1608", "contents": "Numerical Integration of Function That Has a Pole It is common to need to integrate numerically functions that diverge somewhere outside the range of integration. Even if the divergence occurs quite far away, integration formulas like Simpson's, that depend on fitting a polynomial, usually will be inaccurate: near a pole they will be very bad. A method is described that gives formulas that will integrate functions of this kind accurately if the orders and positions of the poles are known. Explicit formulas are given that are easy to use on an automatic computer. It is shown that they can be used for some other singularities as well as poles. If the integral converges, integration can be carried to the singularity. The accuracy of the integration with a pole of second order is discussed, and, as an example, the new formula is compared with Simpson's. The new formulas are useful even far from the pole, while near the pole their advantage is overwhelming. CACM April, 1967 Eisner, E.

The first one is IMOL, an interactive monitor language, which is designed to perform the overall and control functions of the software system; its design criteria provide the user with commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all the functions needed in computer-aided circuit design. The second one is COIF, a circuit oriented graphic language, which is designed to describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem specifications; it is an extension of Fortran with graphic-type variables, so that the designer who is familiar with Fortran need not learn a new language. The application to computer-aided circuit design is in particular examined; on the other hand, the adopted design criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages to different computer-assisted applications.

An efficient method for accomplishing this reorganization is given. This also makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound for multiplication of matrices given in row-oriented form by adapting the technique of Strassen to the reorganized data. The reorganization/block multiplication scheme is shown to be advantageous for matrices and pages of realistic size; the Strassen adaptation is not. The former scheme is also shown to be advantageous even if the transpose of one of the matrices is available at no additional cost. CACM July, 1979 Fischer, P. Probert, R.

This paper is concerned with another, independent, dimension of privacy protection, the control over what a user is allowed to do with a piece of information supplied to him by the database. The ability to condition the supply of information on its intended use is called here \"intentional resolution\" of privacy protection. The practical importance of intentional resolution is demonstrated by several examples, and its realization is discussed. It is shown that intentional resolution can be achieved, but that it involves a radical change from the traditional approach to the process of user-database interaction. In particular, it appears to be necessary for the database to impose a certain amount of control over the internal behavior of users' programs which interact with it. A model for user-database interaction which admits such a control is developed.

{"id": "CACM-3081", "contents": "Shallow Binding in Lisp 1.5 Shallow binding is a scheme which allows the value of a variable to be accessed in a bounded amount of computation. An elegant model for shallow binding in Lisp 1.5 is presented in which context-switching is an environment tree transformation called rerooting. Rerooting is completely general and reversible, and is optional in the sense that a Lisp 1.5 interpreter will operate correctly whether or not rerooting is invoked one very context change. Since rerooting leaves assoc [v, a] invariant, for all variables v and all environments a, the programmer can have access to a rerooting primitive, shallow[], which gives him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow or deep, and which affects only the speed of execution of a program, not its semantics. In addition, multiple processes can be active in the same environment structure, so long as rerooting is an indivisible operation. Finally, the concept of rerooting is shown to combine the concept of shallow binding in Lisp with Dijkstra's display for Algol and hence is a general model for shallow binding.

The design objectives as originally conceived in a special seminar were: (1) to be a research project in computer design; (2) to be usable as an educational machine;and (3) to have easily modifiable hardware for basic research in computer systems design. An unusual arrangement of information within the 22 Mc memory allows a simple interface with the 340 Kc arithmetic unit, which results in an effective zero latency time and provides possibilities for an associative memory. The arithmetic unit has a command structure similar to large parallel machines, and uses flip-flop arithmetic and control registers throughout. All hardware development has been aimed toward the concept of easy modification, elaborate console controls for effective man-machine interaction and low cost. CACM July, 1966 Boles, J. A. Rux, P. T.

{"id": "CACM-1888", "contents": "Spline Function Methods for Nonlinear Boundary-Value Problems The solution of the nonlinear differential equation Y\"=F(x,Y,Y') with two-point boundary conditions is approximated by a quintic or cubic spline function y(x). The method is well suited to nonuniform mesh size and dynamic mesh size allocation. For uniform mesh size h, the error in the quintic spline y(x) is O(h^4), with typical error one-third that from Numerov's method. Requiring the differential equation to be satisfied at the mesh points results in a set of difference equations, which are block tridiagonal and so are easily solved by relaxation or other standard methods.

Virtually all the powerful techniques developed for searching two-person, strictly competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either directly or by analogy into SPR procedures. In particular, one can incorporate the \"mini average backing-up procedure\" and the \"gamma procedure,\" which are the analogues of the \"minimax backing-up procedure\" and the \"alpha-beta procedure,\" respectively.

This paper presents a computer representation for solids and surfaces and algorithms which carry out interference checking among objects so represented. Objects are represented as polyhedra or as piecewise planar surfaces. Two types of interference checking are discussed: detection of intersections among objects in fixed positions and detection of collisions among objects moving along specified trajectories.

To explore the prospects of such a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare a general program for deriving microsentences from longer sentences that had been syntactically analyzed by the Harvard Multipath Analysis Program. The basic idea was to extract the subject, verb and object (if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials into a grammatical microsentence. A program is described in this paper, which was designed to operate on the tree structure output of the analyzer, and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited. The authors conclude that while microsentences of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects for improving the performance of automatic message retrieval systems, they may have practical value in man-machine systems using human monitors to select the preferred syntactic interpretation of a sentence.

{"id": "CACM-1609", "contents": "Scheduling University Course Examinations by Computer A new approach to the problem of scheduling course examinations is presented. In principle, an examination schedule which requires a minimum number of examination periods and satisfies the constraint that no student be required to take two examinations simultaneously can be found in two steps. First, course which may have their examinations scheduled at the same period are grouped together in all possible ways. Then a minimum number of these groups, such that each course is included at least once, are selected. By removing multiple occurrences of courses and then scheduling each group at a different period a minimal schedule can be obtained. Known algorithms for carrying out these procedures are prohibitively expensive. Approximations to the ideal procedure outlined above are given which yield nonminimal but feasible schedules with a very small expenditure of time. Results of experiments using these techniques are given. These are encouraging and indicate that further experimentation would be worthwhile. CACM April, 1967 Hall Jr., A. D. Acton, F. S.

The system organization described is a conceptually simple arrangement of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to process terminal jobs as they arrive. One of the computers serves as the master or control computer and supervises the collection and distribution of messages from and to the remote terminals. In the simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected terminal. A crosspoint switching network allows any such disk drive to be connected to any computer. Thus, while each active terminal user \"occupies\" a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with many other terminal users in a simple manner. The ratio of users to computers is dependent on both the size and power of the machines used and the computation requirements of the particular mix of users. This system organization is inherently a simpler and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers and has the potential of a highly available system at relatively low cost. Economic configurations are possible for a range of systems sizes that span at least one order of magnitude.

{"id": "CACM-2344", "contents": "On the Optimization of Performance of Time-Sharing Systems by Simulation A simulation model of a time-sharing system with a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system parameters such as store size, number of jobs allowed to execute simultaneously, job-scheduling algorithm, etc. The effects of these variations on a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization, and which of the parameters not normally controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked effect on system performance. System performance is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed. It is shown that significant improvements in the measure of system performance can be obtained by using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting the optimum round-robin cycle time. It appears that these features would benefit from optimization whereas other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm affect system performance in a predictable manner and would not benefit from optimization. Features not normally under the control of the scheduling algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU. A comparison is made between the results of the simulation model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented nonpreemptive time-sharing systems. The comparison is found to be very favorable.

{"id": "CACM-3128", "contents": "Synchronization with Eventcounts and Sequencers Synchronization of concurrent processes requires controlling the relative ordering of events in the processes. A new synchronization mechanism is proposed, using abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers, that allows processes to control the ordering of events directly, rather than using mutual exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control ordering of events. Direct control of ordering seems to simplify correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed systems. The mechanism is defined formally, and then several examples of its use are given. The relationship of the mechanism to protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular, eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement of information matters. An implementation of eventcount s and sequencers in a system with shared memory is described. CACM February, 1979 Reed, D. Kanodia, R.

{"id": "CACM-2851", "contents": "Formal Verification of Parallel Programs Two formal models for parallel computation are presented: an abstract conceptual model and a parallel-program model. The former model does not distinguish between control and data states. The latter model includes the capability for the representation of an infinite set of control states by allowing there to be arbitrarily many instruction pointers (or processes) executing the program. An induction principle is presented which treats the control and data state sets on the same ground. Through the use of \"place variables,\" it is observed that certain correctness conditions can be expressed without enumeration of the set of all possible control states. Examples are presented in which the induction principle is used to demonstrate proofs of mutual exclusion. It is shown that assertions-oriented proof methods are special cases of the induction principle. A special case of the assertions method, which is called parallel place assertions, is shown to be incomplete. A formalization of \"deadlock\" is then presented. The concept of a \"norm\" is introduced, which yields an extension, to the deadlock problem, of Floyd's technique for proving termination. Also discussed is an extension of the program model which allows each process to have its own local variables and permits shared global variables. Correctness of certain forms of implementation is also discussed. An Appendix is included which relates this work to previous work on the satisfiability of certain logical formulas.

The \"metalinguistic formulae\" admirably serve the purpose of precisely specifying a language, but they are certainly not very readable for a beginner. However, experience has shown that once the report is explained it is in fact easy to learn ALGOL and to write algorithms in it. The language is so general and powerful it can handle an enormous class of problems. It is not hard to learn those parts of ALGOL present in other compiler languages: how to write assignment and go to and for statements, etc. Indeed, a lot of the unnecessary restrictions imposed by other compiling languages have finally been lifted. But ALGOL also allows many unobvious things to be written, as we will see later, and herein lies a problem: ALGOL seems to have become too general. So many restrictions have been lifted that a lot of technical details crop up which are hard to learn and to use correctly. In this paper some of the more obscure features of the language are considered and their usefulness is discussed. Remarks are based on the authors' interpretations of the ALGOL 60 Report.

{"id": "CACM-0675", "contents": "Coding Clinical Laboratory Data For Automatic Storage and Retrieval A series of clinical laboratory codes have been developed to accept and store urin analysis, blood chemistry, and hematology test results for automatic data processing. The codes, although constructed as part of a computerized hospital simulation, have been able to handle the results of every laboratory test that they have encountered. The unique feature of these codes is that they can accept conventionally recorded qualitative as well as quantitative test results. Consequently, clinical test results need not be arbitrarily stratified, standardized, or altered in any way to be coded. This paper describes how the codes were developed and presents a listing of the urin analysis codes. Five criteria used in developing the codes are outlined and the problem of multiple-synonymous terminology is discussed. A solution to the problem is described. Flexible, computer-produced, composite laboratory reports are also discussed, along with reproduction of such a report.

{"id": "CACM-1390", "contents": "CONVERT A programming language is described which is applicable to problems conveniently described by transformation rules. By this is meant that patterns may be prescribed, each being associated with a skeleton, so that a series of such pairs may be searched until a pattern is found which matches an expression to be transformed. The conditions for a match are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions to be identified and eventually substituted into the corresponding skeleton. The primitive patterns and primitive skeletons are described, as well as the principle which allow their elaboration in to more complicated patterns and skeletons. The advantages of the language are that it allows one to apply transformation rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings, that both patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively, and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely.

The man-machine interface is satisfied by several communication consoles from which operators may enter queries and view replies. A data link permits remote stations to send messages, status reports and inventories directly to the computer. The information received over the on-line data link is used to update the data files which are stored on disk. The 473L programming system is divided into an Executive Control Program and five components with different processing priorities. These priorities permit the system to be most sensitive to the console inputs and permit the operators at all the consoles to time share the central processor. The Executive Control Program provides for the orderly transitions of control among the programming system components. The major emphasis of the paper is on the technique of using the definition of a finite-state automaton for organizing the Executive Control Program. CACM November, 1964 Heistand, R. E.

This study is the first known attempt to evaluate two such systems for what may well be the predominant user population within the next decade-the professionals who, as nonprogrammers, are using the computer as an aid in decision-making and problem-solving rather than as a programming end in itself. Statistically and logically significant results indicate equal cost for usage of the two computer systems; however, a much higher level of performance is attained by time-sharing users. There are indications that significantly lower costs would have resulted if the time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached a performance level equal to that of the batch users. The users' speed of problem-solving and their attitudes made time-sharing the more favorable system. CACM May, 1969 Gold, M.

{"id": "CACM-1877", "contents": "Prevention of System Deadlocks A well-known problem in the design of operating systems is the selection of a resource allocation policy that will prevent deadlock. Deadlock is the situation in which resources have been allocated to various tasks in such a way that none of the tasks can continue. The various published solutions have been somewhat restrictive: either they do not handle the problem in sufficient generality or they suggest policies which will on occasion refuse a request which could have been safely granted. Algorithms are presented which examine a request in the light of the current allocation of resources and determine whether or not the granting of the request will introduce the possibility of a deadlock. Proofs given in the appendixes show that the conditions imposed by the algorithms are both necessary and sufficient to prevent deadlock. The algorithms have been successfully used in the THE system.

In the system described, the user is not required to learn or remember the vocabulary of the language because the vocabulary is displayed before him on\"menus\" by means of a computer-drive scope. He selects the various vocabulary elements required by pointing with the light pen. By use of a small unordered set of rewriting rules applied as a result of light pen selections, the user generates only syntactically correct commands to the system. He does not have to learn or remember the grammar. The program restricts the user severely in the particular language he can use, but the method for communicating with the program makes these restrictions seem quite natural and unconstraining. The program has been used successfully for over ten months. CACM February, 1965 Goodenough, J. B.

{"id": "CACM-1805", "contents": "Productivity of Multiprogrammed Computers-Progress in Developing an Analytic Prediction Method Multiprogramming as it is discussed here is a mode of computer operation in which two or more programs are concurrently in processor memory and proceeding, each using the same central processor unit (CPU) and input-output (I/O) channels. These programs are actually proceeding intermittently and singly, according to eligibility (readiness to proceed) and priority. It is useful to be able to represent them as proceeding continuously and simultaneously, each at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of that which it would enjoy in the absence of the other programs. The effective progress rate of each program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics of itself and its co-residents and simulation has been the best available method of predicting it. This paper presents the results of progress in developing an alternative to simulation, a simulation-tested iterative computation of these rates under certain situations. The algorithm is sensitive to most of the factors that control the phenomenon, including nonquantitative or topological features of the programs' structures. CACM December, 1969 Lasser, D.

Because of this general framework,the requirements specified are applicable to the design of advanced programming systems for a wide range of applications. Three aspects of programming systems are highlighted: good interactive facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated data communication mechanisms. Interactive features are described to facilitate program composition, entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, and packaging. Implementation of a generalized environment structure model specified would allow programming of various control regimes including multiprocesses, coroutines and backtracking. Alternative methods of procedure invocation required include invocation by pattern and by monitoring condition. The need for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility are stressed, as is the duality of data retrieval and function evaluation.

Three topics were covered: curricula for the general manager; computer-related material in required and functional courses; and curricula for students concentrating on computer-based information systems. An analysis of the minutes of the meetings revealed a common set of experiences which raised similar pedagogic and economic issues. This presentation gives a summary of the discussions; a condensation of the pedagogic and substantive concerns raised; and consideration of the resource allocation issues involved.

This system is based on a simple, high level language which is used to describe the evolving system at all stages of its development. The source language description is used as direct input to performance analysis and simulation routines. Using the performance information obtained from these routines as feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance are detected early enough so that they can be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

The analysis is parameterized in terms of the ratio of seek time to the time it takes to fill available core with records, and the file size in units of core lengths; and thus it can be applied to any conventional CPU/mass storage combination. An explicit formula for total read time is derived, in terms of the parameters, which correlates very well with the total read time calculated using the optimum merge orders yielded by the algorithm. The formula involves the roots of a simple transcendental equation. A short table of these roots is included. Numerical results are graphically displayed for a wide range of the parameters. It is found that the normalized read time for optimum merging on a given hardware configuration is proportional to the file length times the logarithm of the file length.

The time complexity of this problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed integer and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test. In the first case, it is shown that for every k there exists an O(n(k+2)) algorithm for testing the LR(k) property, where n is the size of the grammar in question. On the other hand, if both k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for k. More specifically, it is shown that this problem is NP-complete when k is expressed in unary. When k is expressed in binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic exponential time. These results carry over to many other parameterized classes of grammars, such as the LL(k), strong LL(k), SLR(k), LC(k), and strong LC(k) grammars. CACM December, 1975 Hunt, H. B. III Szymanski, T.

Current programming language concepts will not be adequate for building and maintaining systems of the complexity called for by the tasks we attempt. Just as high level languages enabled the programmer to escape from the intricacies of a machine's order code, higher level programming systems can provide the means to understand and manipulate complex systems and components. In order to develop such systems, we need to shift our attention away from the detailed specification of algorithms, towards the description of the properties of the packages and objects with which we build.

{"id": "CACM-3021", "contents": "A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be \"signed\" using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in \"electronic mail\" and \"electronic funds transfer\" systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret prime numbers p and q. Decryption is similar;only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d = 1 (mod(p-1) * (q-1)). the security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.

The traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates all points in the other, but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centered in the empty space between the two classes. Since a central hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better than a noncentral hyperplane. Six algorithms for finding central hyperplanes are tested on three data sets. Although frequently used practice, the modified relaxation algorithm is very poor. Three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to be quite good. CACM March, 1979 Slagle, J.

A technique is described for constructing a detailed deterministic simulation model of a system. In the model a control stream replaces the instruction and data streams of the real system. Simulation of the system model yields the timing and resource usage statistics needed for performance evaluation, without the necessity of emulating the system. As a case study, the implementation of a simulator of a model of the CPU-memory subsystem of the IBM 360/91 is described. The results of evaluating some alternative system designs are discussed. The experiments reveal that, for the case study, the major bottlenecks in the system are the memory unit and the fixed point unit. Further, it appears that many of the sophisticated pipelining and buffering technique simplemented in the architecture of the IBM 360/91 are of little value when high-speed (cache) memory is used, as in the IBM 360/195.

Large scale linear programming codes at most installations are assumed to be generating correct solutions without ever having been \"bench-marked\" by test problems with known solutions. The reason for this failure to adequately test the codes is that rarely are there large problems with known solutions readily available.

It is generally accepted that some knowledge of the hardware and computer logic must be possessed by the programmer. The teaching problem arises in determining how thoroughly a student must know the hardware and logic for that computer for which he will write COBOL programs. Unfortunately, historical data concerning students' programming proficiency is almost non-existent and, at best, difficult to measure. How then might we approach solving this problem?

{"id": "CACM-2438", "contents": "A Model and Stack Implementation of Multiple Environments Many control and access environment structures require that storage for a procedure activation exist at times when control is not nested within the procedure activated. This is straightforward to implement by dynamic storage allocation with linked blocks for each activation, but rather expensive in both time and space. This paper presents an implementation technique using a single stack to hold procedure activation storage which allows retention of that storage for durations not necessarily tied to control flow. The technique has the property that, in the simple case,it runs identically to the usual automatic stack allocation and deallocation procedure. Applications of this technique to multitasking, coroutines, backtracking, label-valued variables, and functional arguments are discussed. In the initial model, a single real processor is assumed, and the implementation assumes multiple-processes coordinate by passing control explicitly to one another. A multiprocessor implementation requires only a few changes to the basic technique, as described. CACM October, 1973 Bobrow, D. G.

The algorithms are designed to work well in systems which use multiple levels of storage, and large virtual address space. They depend on the fact that most cells are referenced exactly once, and that reference counts need only be accurate when storage is about to be reclaimed. A transaction file stores changes to reference counts, and a multiple reference table stores the count for items which are referenced more than once. CACM September, 1976 Deutsch, L. P. Bobrow, D.

There are three important elements in this general construction method; namely, a set of binary relations, an algorithm for constructing subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an element from the given set of objects. The use of different relations and algorithms results in different information structures, as list, tree, ring, etc. Thus the problem of information organization and storage is reduced to that of defining relations and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.

Pictorial pattern recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches to X-ray structure determination based on molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information to frame \"structural hypotheses\" which can computationally be tested and refined by reference to the experimental data. Application of standard pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact that the cross-correlation between a model and the correct structure cannot be computed because of a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such a cross-correlation. A simple example demonstrates that this information can be the basis of a technique for structure determination that can make effective use of an interactive graphics system. Model building by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages over usual crystallographic techniques based on the autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially for large structures. This is significant, for crystallography of biological macromolecules hasbeen and will continue to be a field of intense interest. CACM January, 1972 Lesk, A.

When a collection of varying-length records is to be accessed from specified drum positions, it is known that the SLTF discipline does not necessarily minimize the drum latency time.

A number of procedures convert Taylor series expansions directly into sampling steps, an approach which may be used for sampling from any continuous distribution. For the exponential distribution a definite recommendation can be made, whereas in the case of the normal distribution there remains a choice between slower and shorter algorithms and faster but space consuming methods.

The virtue of these axioms is that they permit a representation-independent formal specification of a data type.

First, it is shown how the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify the process of proving the correctness of an implementation of an abstract data type. Second, semi-automatic tools are described which can be used both to automate such proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate implementation from the axioms.

{"id": "CACM-2916", "contents": "A Fast String Searching Algorithm An algorithm is presented that searches for the location, \"i,\" of the first occurrence of a character string, \"pat,\" in another string, \"string.\" During the search operation, the characters of pat are matched starting with the last character of pat. The information gained by starting the match at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithm to proceed in large jumps through the text being searched. Thus the algorithm has the unusual property that, in most cases, not all of the first i characters of string are inspected. The number of characters actually inspected (on the average) decreases as a function of the length of pat. For a random English pattern of length 5, the algorithm will typically inspect i/4 characters of string before finding a match at i. Furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented so that (on the average) fewer than i+patlen machine instructions are executed. These conclusions are supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm. The worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in i+patlen, assuming the availability of array space for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet. CACM October, 1977 Boyer, R.

{"id": "CACM-2060", "contents": "GEDANKEN-A Simple Typeless Language Based on the Principle of Completeness and the Reference Concept GEDANKEN is an experimental programming language with the following characteristics. (1) Any value which is permitted in some context of the language is permissible in any other meaningful context. In particular, functions and labels are permissible results of functions and values of variables. (2) Assignment and indirect addressing are formalized by introducing values, called reference, which in turn possess other values. The assignment operation always affects the relation between some reference and its value, (3) All compound data structures are treated as functions. (4) Type declarations are not permitted. The functional approach to data structures and the use of references insure that any process which accepts some data structure will accept any logically equivalent structure, regardless of its internal representation. More generally, any data structure may be implicit; i.e. it may be specified by giving an arbitrary algorithm for computing or accessing its components.

Particular emphasis is given to the system of \"significant addresses\" by means of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures can be substantially reduced. The description makes frequent use of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the parser in an experimental English sentence analyzer. By structuring an area of the computer's central core storage in such a way that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of information is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists is eliminated altogether. The matches are traced by means of binary masks and the state of single bits determines the operational flow of the procedure. The method could be implemented with any interpretive grammar, provided it can be expressed by the functional classification of the items composing the input hierarchical structures.

{"id": "CACM-2939", "contents": "Abstraction Mechanisms in CLU CLU is a new programming language designed to support the use of abstractions in program construction. Work in programming methodology has led to the realization that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, control, and especially data abstractions-are useful in the programming process. Of these, only the procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional languages, through the procedure or subroutine. CLU provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic mechanisms that support the use of data and control abstractions. This paper provides an in troduction to the abstraction mechanisms in CLU. By means of programming examples, the utility of the three kinds of abstractions in program construction is illustrated, and it is shown how CLU programs may be written to use and implement abstractions. The CLU library, which permits incremental program development with complete type checking performed at compile time, is also discussed. CACM August, 1977 Liskov, B. Snyder, A. Atkinson, R.

The optimization consists of replacing a procedure invocation by a modified copy of the procedure body. The general problem of using inline substitution to minimize execution time subject to size constrain ts is formulated, and an approximate algorithmic solution is proposed. The algorithm depends on run-time statistics about the program to be optimized. Preliminary results for the CLU structured programming language indicate that, in programs with a low degree of recursion, over 90 percent of all procedure calls can be eliminated, with little increase in the size of compiled code and a small savings in execution time.

{"id": "CACM-2598", "contents": "Extending the Information Theory Approach to Converting Limited-Entry Decision Tables to Computer Programs This paper modifies an earlier algorithm for converting decision tables into flowcharts which minimize subsequent execution time when compiled into a computer program. The algorithms considered in this paper perform limited search and, accordingly, do not necessarily result in globally optimal solutions. However, the greater search effort needed to obtain a globally optimal solution for complex decision tables is usually not justified by sufficient savings in execution time. There is an analogy between the problem of converting decision tables into efficient flowcharts and the well-understood problem in information theory of noiseless coding. The results of the noiseless coding literature are used to explore the limitations of algorithms used to solve the decision table problem. The analogy between the two problems is also used to develop improvements to the information algorithm in extending the depth of search under certain conditions and in proposing additional conditions to be added to the decision table. Finally, the information algorithm is compared with an algorithm proposed in a recent paper by Verhelst.

A graph theoretic algorithm which examines an arbitrary n x n matrix and determines whether or not it can be permuted into tridiagonal form is given. The algorithm requires no arithmetic while the number of comparisons, the number of assignments, and the number of increments are linear in n. This compares very favorably with standard transformation methods. If the matrix is permutable into tridiagonal form, the algorithm gives the explicit tridiagonal form.

{"id": "CACM-2196", "contents": "A Man-Machine Approach Toward Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem The traveling salesman problem belongs to an important class of scheduling and routing problems. It is also a subproblem in solving others, such as the warehouse distribution problem. It has been attacked by many mathematical methods with but meager success. Only for special forms of the problem or for problems with a moderate number of points can it be solved exactly, even if very large amounts of computer time are used. Heuristic procedures have been proposed and tested with only slightly better results. This paper describes a computer aided heuristic technique which uses only a modest amount of computer time in real-time to solve large (100-200) point problems. This technique takes advantage of both the computer's and the human's problem-solving abilities. The computer is not asked to solve the problem in a brute force way as in many of today's heuristics, but it is asked to organize the data for the human so that the human can solve the problem easily. The technique used in this paper seems to point to new directions in the field of man-machine interaction and in the field of artificial intelligence. CACM May, 1971 Krolak, P. Felts, W.

This implies that all applications-no matter how large, complex or time consuming-must operate under (or, more precisely, on top of) the standard system. Large applications require supervisory monitors which handle problems similar to those of the operating systems, but at a different level.

Parallel-processor systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of the processors can simultaneously execute separate tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease the solution time of a computational problem. The processors have independent instruction counters, meaning that each processor executes its own task program relatively independently of the other processors. Communication between cooperating processors is by means of data in storage shared by all processors. A program for the determination of the distribution of current in an electrical network was written for a parallel-processor computing system, and execution of this program was simulated. The data gathered from simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution of this problem, typical of a large class of important problems. It is shown that, with proper programming, solution time when N processors are applied approaches 1/N times the solution time for a single processor, while improper programming can actually lead to an increase of solution time with the number of processors. Stability of the method of solution was also investigated. CACM December, 1969 Rosenfeld, J.

First, the paper describes the recursion-removal process and the example on which it will be illustrated.

These models show that adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary conditions for an optimal routing, Adaptive routing tends to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate routes because it does not consider the impact of its current routing decision on the future state of the network. The form of the optimality conditions suggests that a modification of the adaptive algorithm will result in optimality. The modification requires the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each network node. Simulation results are presented which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network. CACM January, 1976 Agnew, C.

The results also indicate that the chargeout systems characteristic of advanced EDP stage environments are associated with relatively high levels of positive user attitudes and marked increases in EDP training for users. Both factors are important to the user/manager involvement necessary for effective control of computer-based systems.

A spanning tree is grown and the vertices examined in turn, unexamined vertices being stored in a pushdown list to await examination. One stage in the process is to take the top element v of the pushdown list and examine it, i.e. inspect all those edges (v,z) of the graph for which z has not yet been examined. If z is already in the tree, a fundamental cycle is added; if not, the edge (v,z) is placed in the tree. There is exactly one such stage for each of the n vertices of the graph. For large n, the store required in creases as n^2 and the time as n^g where g depends on the type of graph involved. g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3, and it is shown that both bounds are attained. In terms of storage our algorithm is similar to that of Gotlieb and Corneil and superior to that of Welch; in terms of speed it is similar to that of Welch and superior to that of Gotlieb and Corneil. Testsshow our algorithm to be remarkably efficient (g=2) on random graphs.

Finally, the remaining words are assigned to one class or another on the basis of the most probable form classes to occur within the already identified contexts.

This paper shows that expression execution time can be minimized only if consideration is given to the ordering of the subexpressions. In particular, subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing memory and processor time requirements. This observation is valid for configurations ranging from a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to multiprocessor with a \"cache\" buffer memory. If the number of subexpressions which can be executed in parallel exceeds the number of available processors, then execution of some of these subexpressions must be postponed.

An important version of the problem in medicine is that of obtaining the exact density distribution within the human body from X-ray projectionsne approach that has been taken to solve this problem consists of translating the available information into a system of linear inequalities. The size and the sparsity of the resulting system (typically, 25,000 inequalities with fewer than 1 percent of the coefficients nonzero) makes methods using successive relaxations computationally attractive, as compared to other ways of solving systems of inequalities. In this paper, it is shown that, for a consistent system of linear inequalities, any sequence of relaxarion parameters lying strictly between 0 and 2 generates a sequence of vectors which converges to a solution. Under the same assumptions, for a system of linear equations, the relaxation method converges to the minimum norm solution. Previously proposed techniques are shown to be special cases of our procedure with different choices of relaxation parameters.

It is here empirically shown that generators of this type can produce sequences whose autocorrelation functions up to lag 50 exhibit evidence of nonrandomness for many multiplicative constants. An alternative generator proposed by Tausworthe, which uses irreducible polynomials over the field of characteristic two, is shown to be free from this defect. The applicability of these two generators to the IBM 360 is then discussed. Since computer word size can affect a generator's statistical behavior the older mixed and simple congruential generators, although extensively tested on computers having 36 or more bits per word, may not be optimum generators for the IBM 360.

The ultimate objective was to develop a technique for predicting the amount of time necessary to create a computer program. The fifteen program characteristics hypothesized as being associated with an increase in programming time required are objectively measurable from preprogramming specifications. The five programmer characteristics are experience-related and are also measurable before a programming task is begun. Nine program characteristics emerged as major influences on program development time, each associated with increased program development time. All five programmer characteristics were found to be related to reduced program development time. A multiple regression equation which contained one programmer characteristic and four program characteristics gave evidence of good predictive power for forecasting program development time.

These measurements reveal substantial regularity, or predictability, among poin ters to atoms and especially among poin ters to lists. Pointers to atoms are found to obey, roughly, Zipf's law, which governs word frequencies in natural languages; poin ters to lists usually poin t to a location physically nearby in memory. The use of such regularities in the space-efficient representation of list structure is discussed. Linearization of lists, whereby successive cdrs (or cars) are placed in consecutive memory locations whenever possible, greatly strengthens the observed regularity of list structure. It is shown that under some reasonable assumptions, the entropy or information content of a car-cdr pair in the programs measured is about 10 to 15 bits before linearization, and about 7 to 12 bits after.

For sufficiently large trees, the execution times of all procedures for maintaining HB[1] trees are independent of the size of the tree. In particular, an average of .465 restructures are required per insertion, with an average of 2.78 nodes revisited to restore the HB[1] property; an average of .214 restructures are required per deletion, with an average of 1.91 nodes revisited to restore the HB[1] property. Moreover,the execution times of procedures for maintaining HB[k] trees, for k>1, are also independent of the size of the tree except for the average number of nodes revisited on a delete operation in order to restore the HB[k] property on trace back.

{"id": "CACM-1379", "contents": "A Final Solution to the Dangling Else of ALGOL 60 and Related Languages The dangling else problem consists of a class of potential ambiguities in ALGOL-like conditional statements whose basic form is \"if B1 then if B2 then S1 else S2\" where B1 and B2 are Boolean expressions and S1 and S2 are basic statements. The difficulty lies in whether to attach the else to the first if or to the second one. Existing solutions to the problem are either ambiguous or unnecessarily restrictive. Let Sand S1 be statements. We define S to be closed if \"S else S1\" is not a statement, and to be open if \"S else S1\" is a statement. Thus an unconditional statement is a closed statement. Open and closed conditional statements are defined by syntax equations in such a way as to preserve openness and closure. In each case, an else must always be preceded by a closed statement. It is shown that the syntax equations are unambiguous, and that may change in the statement types required within the syntax equations would lead to either ambiguity or unnecessary restriction.

{"id": "CACM-2341", "contents": "Blocks-A New Data type for SNOBOL4 A new data type, called a block, has been implemented for SNOBOL4. A block is a three-dimensional aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped, best thought of as a three-dimensional extension to a string. (The third dimension is used for overstriking.) Blocks may be printed, concatenated in any of three dimensions, and merged on the basis of program-defined connection points. Some blocks adapt in size and shape to their environment. Blocks and their operations are mainly used for composing printable output. A variety of graphical problems (including flowcharting, bargraphs, logic diagrams, mathematical-equation formation, and text justification and preparation) have been programmed on a printer in what appears to be an easy and natural way. In addition to these somewhat specialized applications, blocks appear to be a good general purpose device-independent output formation mechanism especially suitable for nonnumerical work. The concept of a block is largely language independenthat is, blocks require little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily be absorbed into the external structure of most programming languages.

{"id": "CACM-1323", "contents": "A Correspondence Between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-Notation: Part I* This paper describes how some of the semantics of ALGOL 60 can be formalized by establishing a correspondence between expressions of ALGOL 60 and expressions in a modified form of Church's L-notation. First a model for computer languages and compute behavior is described, based on the notions of functional application and functional abstraction, but also having analogues for imperative language features. Then this model is used as an \"abstract object language\" into which ALGOL 60 is mapped. Many of ALGOL 60's features emerge as particular arrangements of a small number of structural rules, suggesting new classifications and generalizations. The correspondence is first described informally, mainly by illustrations. The second part of the paper gives a formal description, i.e. an \"abstract compiler\" into the \"abstract objct language.\" This is itself presented in a \"purely functional\" notation, that is one using only application and abstraction.

Each procedure is defined by giving an algorithm for obtaining a nondeterministic Turing Machine recognizer that is equivalent to a given context-free grammar. The formalization of the Turing Machine has been chosen to make possible particularly simple description of the parsing procedures considered. An attempt has been made to compare recognition efficiencies for the procedures defined. For a few simple grammars and sentences a formal comparison has been made. Empirical comparison of the recognition of more realistic programming languages such as LISP and ALGOL has been made by means of a program which simulates the Turing Machine on the Univac M-460 computer.

{"id": "CACM-1066", "contents": "Growing Applications of Linear Programming Use of linear programming models has grown so extensively in recent years that the whole concept for organizing a computer code has undergone a radical change. It no longer is adequate merely to reduce a mathematical algorithm (i.e. the simplex method) to a computer code. An advanced code must cope with such a variety of situations that the respective computer subprograms must be organized into an integrated system. Emphasis in this paper is devoted to the underlying principles upon which future linear programming systems must be based. These viewpoints are influenced by the new demands that applications within the petroleum industry are placing on such systems. Some of the components of such a system are: translation of problem statement in terms of basic data to linear programming matrix coefficients, data transmission for direct computer entry, data file at the computer center, data processing and editing prior to solving the simplex algorithm, an efficient and reliable code for solving the above-mentioned algorithm, and flexible means for summarizing the results.

PLEXUS is designed to complement neurophysiological research so that the systematic development of neural models can be coordinated with experimental work. PLEXUS networks are built up from components representing individual neurons, external stimuli, and interconnecting fibers, each component being of a relatively detailed nature. Provision is also made for the use of experimental data as input to a network. Convenient means for specification and modification of a network and extensive error-checking capabilities are provided.

Rather than simply use the new power to achieve fast turnaround, we can develop interactive routines which are easy to use and also take advantage of the insight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver. Several on-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solving have already been implemented as well as some special purpose systems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinary differential equations. The advantage of restricting the problem area is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified. In this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by such systems and design considerations for interactive routines. Furthermore, an implementation of an on-line least squares data-fitting program, PEG, is presented with results obtained from empirical data.

The method was designed to be general purpose in nature but to be especially efficient when dealing with stiff systems of differential equations. It is, in general, second order except for the case of a linear system with constant coefficients and linear forcing terms; in that case, the method is third order. It has been implemented and put to routine usage in biological applications-where stiffness frequently appears-with favorable results. When compared to a standard fourth order Runge-Kutta implementation, computation time required by this method has ranged from comparable for certain nonstiff problems to better than two orders of magnitude faster for some highly stiff systems.

The method relies on hand selection of a set of text strings which are common to one or more messages. These phrases are then stored only once.

The average asymptotic number of comparisons needed is shown to be an log^2(n). A formula is derived expressing a in terms of the probability distribution of the \"bound\" of a partition. This formula assumes a particularly simple form for a generalization already considered by Hoare, namely, choice of the bound as median of a random sample. The main contribution of this paper is another generalization of quicksort, which uses a bounding interval instead of a single element as bound. This generalization turns out to be easy to implement in a computer program. A numerical approximation shows that a = 1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with 1.386 for the original. This implies a decrease in number of comparisons of 18 percent; actual tests showed about 15 percent saving in computing time. CACM September, 1970 van Emden, M.

The design objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment. For the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compiler. The most remarkable characteristic of PL/C is its perseverance-it completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a user-established error limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution, and the design of PL/C is dominated by this consideration. PL/C also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing. To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without abandoning compatibility with IBM compiler PL/C permits \"pseudo comments\"-constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source test or comment. In spite of the diagnostic effort PL/C is a fast and efficient processor.

{"id": "CACM-1051", "contents": "Multiword List Items The list concept as originally proposed by Newell, Simon and Shaw specified single computer words as elements of a list. This report describes the use of two or more consecutive words as one element. Such use results in a considerable saving in both the space required to hold a given amount of data, and in the execution time required to perform a given process on the data. Following a brief description of standard list structures with single-word items, the multiword items are introduced. Then variable-length items are described, along with the corresponding space-utilization problems. Finally, several examples are given to illustrate the use of multiword lists. This paper attempts to draw together various recent papers which have applied some of these concepts in different ways, and indicate how they relate to the more general problems.

{"id": "CACM-2358", "contents": "The Multics Virtual Memory: Concepts and Design As experience with use of on-line operating systems has grown, the need to share information among system users has become increasingly apparent. Many contemporary systems permit some degree of sharing. Usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing several users to share data via input and output of information stored in files kept in secondary storage. Through the use of segmentation, however, Multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and system programs of all information, independent of its physical storage location. Information is stored in segments each of which is potentially sharable and carries its own independent attributes of size and access privilege. Here, the design and implementation considerations of segmentation and sharing in Multics are first discussed under the assumption that all information resides in large, segmented main memory. Since the size of main memory on contemporary systems is rather limited, it is then shown how the Multics software achieves the effect of a large segmented main memory through the use of the Honeywell 645 segmentation and paging hardware.

One application is the comparing of two versions of a source program or other file in order to display all differences. The algorithm isolates differences in a way that corresponds closely to our intuitive notion of difference, is easy to implement, and is computationally efficient, with time linear in the file length. For most applications the algorithm isolates differences similar to those isolated by the longest common subsequence. Another application of this algorithm merges files containing independently generated changes into a single file. The algorithm can also be used to generate efficient encodings of a file in the form of the differences between itself and a given \"datum\" file, permitting reconstruction of the original file from the difference and datum files.

Through the use of redundancy and storing keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations of secondary index values in \"buckets,\" it is possible to retrieve all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may be used for many combinations of values and a combination of buckets may be required for a given query. The method which, in its degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index field appearing in a query has very few possible values.

The construction of a schedule entails determining which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially with respect to each other. A concise scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize the time for executing the entire pending workload (or any subset of it), subject to external constraints such as precedence, urgency, etc. The algorithm is applicable to a wide class of machines.

Several analytic models are introduced, and it is shown that such hierarchies may operate in ways which differ from those of more conventional hierarchies. In particular, it is shown that it may not be necessary to multiprogram in such a situation. In the past, backing storage devices have been roughly symmetric with respect to their read and write times. This situation may not continue, as several devices are currently under development which may have a very small read-time/write-time ratio.

A condition for an attribute grammar is given which assures that the semantics of any program can be evaluated in a single pass over the derivation tree, and an algorithm is discussed which decides how many passes from left to right are in general necessary, given the attribute grammar. These notions are explained in terms of an example grammar which describes the scope rules of Algol 60.

That is, lists may be \"overlapped.\" Unfortunately, overlapping poses a problem for subsequent erasure. Given a list that is no longer needed, it is desired to erase just those parts that do not overlap other lists. In LISP, McCarthy employs an elegant but inefficient solution to the problem. The present paper describes a general method which enables efficient erasure. The method employs interspersed reference counts to describe the extent of the overlapping.

In this technique the heuristic of the problem is not embedded in the recognition algorithm but is expressed in a figure of merit. A multistage decision process is then able to recognize in the input picture the optimal system of lines according to the given figure of merit. Due to the global approach, greater flexibility and adequacy in the particular problem is achieved. The relation between the structure of the figure of merit and the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed. The method described is suitable for parallel processing because the operations relative to each state can be computed in parallel, and the number of stages is equal to the length N of the curves (or to log2 N if the approximate method is used).

{"id": "CACM-3163", "contents": "An Optimal Insertion Algorithm for One-Sided Height-Balanced BInary Search Trees An algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced (OSHB) binary search tree is presented. The algorithm operates in time O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This represents an improvement over the best previous ly known insertion algorithms of Hirschberg and Kosaraju, which require time O(log 2n). Moreover, the O(log n) complexity is optimal. Earlier results have shown that deletion in such a structure can also be performed in O(log n) time. Thus the result of this paper gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should be the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time complexity than insertion. Furthermore, it can now be concluded that insertion, deletion, and retrieval in OSHB trees can be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for the more general AVL trees, to within a constant factor. However, the insertion and deletion algorithms for OSHB trees appear much more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for AVL trees. CACM September, 1979 Raiha,K. Zweben, S.

On the IBM 360-65, COKO III plays a minimal chess game at the rate of .2 sec cpu time per move, with a level close to lower chess club play. A selective tree searching procedure controlled by tactical chess logistics allows a deployment of multiple minimal game calculations to achieve some optimal move selection. The tree searching algorithms are the heart of COKO's effectiveness, yet they are conceptually simple. In addition, an interesting phenomenon called a tree searching catastrophe has plagued COKO's entire development just as it troubles a human player. Standard exponential growth is curbed to a large extent by the definition and trimming of the Fischer set. A clear distinction between tree pruning and selective tree searching is also made. Representation of the chess environment is described along with a strategical preanalysis procedure that maps the Lasker regions.

Binary search techniques are efficient for searching large files, but the associated file organization is not readily adapted to the file alterations. Conversely, a chained file allocation permits efficient alteration but cannot be searched efficiently. A file organized into a tree-like structure is discussed, and it is shown that such a file may both be searched and altered with times proportional to slog(s)N, where N is the number of file items and s is a parameter of the tree. It is also shown that optimizing the value of s leads to a search time which is only 25 per cent slower than the binary search. The tree organization employs two data chains and may be considered to be a compromise between the organizations for the binary search and the chained file.

The planned routing is the basis for rerouting interconnections within the aperture to resolve conflicts for lines and vias below the aperture and to maximize the effective line usage.

Two principles are presented as paramount in the provision of information services: (1) easy accessibility to the information files by users unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value of service exceeding user costs. These principles serve as guides in mechanizing the ACM Repository. The main features of the information system are direct user access via on-line teletypewriter console, direct user access to all details of the system organization, unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, user access through many facets of document indexing, and stochastic search through linked index terms and other file relationships. The first contribution to the ACM Repository consisted of 315 documents, relating primarily to early research on compilers. These documents have been cataloged and indexed and the catalog is scheduled to appear in Computing Reviews. The indexing system is described in detail. The Main Catalog is used to describe the documents, and inverted lists are provided by the Repository system for retrieval by concept coordination. CACM October, 1965 Rubinoff, M. White Jr., J. F.

The industry is highly regulated by government and, hence, is subject to many statutes and regulations. It also is affected by important common law rules established by courts. The legal ramifications involve not only the mechanization itself, but also the very significant, economically attractive phenomenon of off premises processing. It is essential to identify and provide for many legal aspects right now, before systems and practices crystallize, in order to avoid the later impact of unanticipated physical complications and expense. The legal aspects of computerization in the banking business are especially diverse. In some states, there might be the basic question whether banks are authorized by law to invest in the new facilities, either directly or through cooperatives. More challenging are questions relating to off-premises processors, particularly with respect to the obligation not to disclose information concerning a bank's customers, the adequacy of fidelity bond coverage, the extent of liability for improper refusal to pay a check, and susceptibility to regulation by government agencies. Also pertinent is the propriety of data processing by banks for nonbank entities and particularly of the rendering of that service without charge for bank depositors. CACM December, 1963 Freed, R. N.

Detection and/or prevention of deadlocks can require massive amounts of additional overhead if efficient usage of resources is to be maintained. A resource management program is described which uses linked lists along with other techniques to overcome a large portion of this overhead. The program, which is currently running as part of a large scale general purpose operating system, keeps resources relatively active but does not detect or prevent all deadlocks in its implemented state. Certain changes, which would permit more comprehensive levels of deadlock prevention/detection at additional cost, have not been incorporated in the running system due to the infrequency of deadlock situations.

Each BRAD (Brookhaven Raster Display) console can plot tens of thousands of points, or up to 4000 characters at 30 frames per second. After an initial display system investment of $50,000 each display, with teletype, costs less than $3,000. The technique employed is that of programmatically generating a binary image of the desired display in a computer. The image is written on a rotating drum memory. Independent read heads continuously display the picture, which is generated by swept horizontal lines. A standard TV monitor serves as the display device. The technique has two drawbacks. A computer must compute any image to be displayed. Also, the \"pointing\" interaction is more difficult. This is because the pointing function gives only the coordinates of the point on the screen. The inverse of the map generation process is required to calculate the coordinates of the point on the screen.

The characteristics used to form word classes are the depth in the dependency tree of each word, the direction of its governor and the same features for each of its immediate neighbors. Syntactic rules of combination show the relation of a word to its governor in the depth pattern of the sentence. The system was tested on 400 elementary basic English sentences including 300 used earlier by Knowlton in a different learning parser of all 400 sentences. After experience with 300 sentences it was able to generalize with 77 percent accuracy to the next 100. In accumulative learning trials after the first 200 sentences it averaged a probability of .9 for accurately parsing each new sentence it encountered. It was concluded that the system is adequate for learning to parse the bulk of basic English but that further development is required before conclusions about its application to ordinary English can be stored.

The firm seeks to maximize total expected profit for the coming period by selecting one of five operating plans, where each plan incorporates a certain marketing strategy, an allocation of productive inputs, and a total cost. The results of the simulated activity under each plan are subjected to an F-test, two multiple comparison methods, and a multiple ranking method. We illustrate, compare, and evaluate these techniques. The paper adopts the position that the particular technique of analysis (possibly not any one of the above) chosen by the experimenter should be an expression of his experimental objective: The F-test tests the homogeneity of the plans; multiple comparison methods quantify their differences; and multiple ranking methods directly identify the one best plan or best plans.

Important common features of list-processing languages are reviewed: forms of data structures which are manipulated, necessity for dynamic allocation of storage, use of pushdown stores, and use of recursive operations. Principal differences between the four languages under consideration are detailed: representations of data, both by the programmer and within the machine; methods for storage allocation; programming formalisms and special processes available, including arithmetic facilities; and usability in terms of availability, documentation, learning aids and debugging facilities. A rough comparison shows that all the languages discussed have approximately the same speed. Finally, the authors give some heuristics to aid in the selection of one of these languages for use in particular problem applications, concluding that no one of the languages considered is distinctly superior in all possible list-processing applications.

{"id": "CACM-3041", "contents": "Median Split Trees: A Fast Lookup Technique for Frequently Occuring Keys Split trees are a new technique for searching sets of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions. A split tree is a binary search tree each node of which contains two key values-a node value which is a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split value which partitions the remaining keys (with respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and right subtrees. A median split tree (MST) uses the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split value to force the search tree to be perfectly balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation of the tree and high search speed. Unlike frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a successful search of an MST is log n bounded and very stable around minimal values. Further, an MST can be built for a given key ordering and set of frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n2 for an optimum binary search tree. A discussion of the application of MST's to dictionary lookup for English is presented, and the performance obtained is contrasted with that of other techniques. CACM November, 1978 Sheil, B.

{"id": "CACM-3077", "contents": "Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs Conventional programming languages are growing ever more enormous, but not stronger. Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common ancestor-the von Neumann computer, their close coupling off semantics to state transitions, their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs. An alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages. Associated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose \"unknowns\" are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs. A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its state transition rules. Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to states-only one state transition occurs per major computation. CACM August, 1978 Backus, J.

A purely random generator will produce base trees which will be blocked by the transformations, and which are frequently too long to be of practical interest. A solution is offered in the form of a computer program which allows the user to constrain and direct the generation by the simple but powerful device of restricted subtrees. The program is a directed random generator which accepts as input a subtree with restrictions and produces around it a tree which satisfies the restrictions and is ready for the next phase of the grammar. The underlying linguistic model is that at Noam Chomsky, as presented in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax. The program is written in FORTRAN IV for the IBM 360/67 and is part of a unified computer system for transformational grammar. It is currently being used with several partial grammars of English.

{"id": "CACM-2194", "contents": "How To Keep the Addresses Short An algorithm is presented for minimizing the sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced by an assembler or compiler when (1) the length of each computer instruction is assumed to be either \"long\" or \"short\" (\"long,\" if the memory location addressed is more than a predetermined distance from the current location; \"short,\" otherwise), and (2) there are blocks of instructions whose beginnings (origins) are separated by prespecified amounts. For example, some computers permit either 8-bit addressing (interpreted relative to the location counter) or full 16-bit addressing of all of memory. When assembling or compiling two or more blocks of instructions which have many mutual references in such a computer, there is no simple iterative procedure for keeping as many of the addresses short as possible. This paper demonstrates that a wide class of problems of this type can be formulated as covering problems solvable by means of elementary arithmetic operations on the column vectors of a ternary matrix.

Techniques for implementing the algorithm and several examples are discussed. The algorithm promises sufficient power to be used efficiently in an online system for symbolic mathematics.

Essential objectives sought are improved ease and economy in model generation, economy in execution time and space, and a facility for handling simultaneous activities. The main results obtained are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral model description, a reduction of manual tasks in converting Boolean logic into a structural model, the elimination of manual processes in achieving exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling technique which does not deteriorate in economy as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation procedure which deals effectively with any mixture of serial and simultaneous activities. The passage of time is simulated in a precise, quantitative fashion and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous and asynchronous logic.

The algorithm is sufficiently powerful to be used on recursive programs and to deal with the sharing of variables which arises through reference parameters. The algorithm is unique in that it can compute all of this information in a single pass, not requiring a prepass to compute calling relationships or sharing patterns.

The results of the simulation studies presented show that neither scheduling discipline is unconditionally superior to the other. For most fixed-head drum applications, the SLTF discipline is preferable to MTPT, but for intra-cylinder disk scheduling the MTPT discipline offers a distinct advantage over the SLTF discipline. The computational requirements of an algorithm that implements the MTPT scheduling discipline are shown to be comparable to SLTF algorithms.

{"id": "CACM-3033", "contents": "Optimizing Decision Trees Through Heuristically Guided Search Optimal decision table conversion has been tackled in the literature using two approaches, dynamic programming and branch-and-bound. The former technique is quite effective, but its time and space requirements are independent of how \"easy\" the given table is. Furthermore, it cannot be used to produce good, quasi optimal solutions. The branch-and-bound technique uses a good heuristic to direct the search, but is cluttered up by an enormous search space, since the number of solutions increases with the number of test variables according to a double exponential. In this paper we suggest a heuristically guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic programming, recognizes identical subproblems but which can be used to find both optimal and quasi optimal solutions. The heuristic search method introduced in this paper combines the positive aspects of the above two techniques. Compressed tables with a large number of variables can be handled without deriving expanded tables first. CACM December, 1978 Martelli, A. Montanari, U.

Each of these is then added to the appropriate one of n auxiliary t-digit accumulators. Finally, the accumulators are added together to yield the computed sum. In all, qN+n-1 t-digit floating-point additions are performed. Under usual conditions, the relative error in the computed sum is at most [(t+1)/v]B^(1-t) for some v. Further, with an additional q+n-1 t-digit additions, the computed sum can be corrected to full t-digit accuracy.

{"id": "CACM-1408", "contents": "The Eschenbach Drum Scheme The prime function of a drum, operating in real time, is to perform accesses quickly. The usual means for increasing this capacity is to incorporate engineering or hardware improvements. In this paper the problem is attacked not by changing the drum, but rather by modifying the manner in which it operates. At the outset, a drum is given a functional definition. Then a simple design scheme (Eschenbach) is introduced which enormously increases the rate of accessing for drums so defined. This is shown to enable a system to perform a job by employing fewer or less expensive drums. It is suggested that although the design scheme has a specific use, the method underlying it has more general applicability. The question of the efficacy of the drum scheme is then raised. To deal with this, a standard of efficiency is developed in light of realistic real-time circumstances. The drum scheme is then modelled in a manner which permits it to be analyzed as a problem in queueing theory. Thus one is enabled to ascertain whether the drum scheme is efficient enough for its application. Again, whereas the analysis of the drum scheme has a specific use, the methods underlying it have more general applicability. CACM July, 1966 Weingarten, A.

The formulas are all rational algebraic expressions in a single variable and were constructed by a recurrence procedure. They are of interest in molecular quantum chemistry. Trivial coding techniques were used to write the relevant programs in FORTRAN. The results were photo composed on a Photon S-560 system, that was controlled by tapes which were punched directly from the computer output, so avoiding manual keyboarding, transcription errors and keyboarded correction.

The system is described and results are given in terms of microprogram and main storage space required and compiler and interpreter performance obtained. The role of microprogramming is stressed, which opens a new dimension in the processing of interpretive code.

When the number of variables, n, is large, this requirement taxes the storage capacity of presently used machinery. The near symmetry of the matrices involved permits a modification requiring only half the storage and computations of the conventional algorithm and this additional storage allows the analysis of problems containing more variables.

Mechanisms are presented for dealing with objects, including the creation of new types, specification of new operations applicable to a given type, sharing, and protection of any reference to a given object against improper application of any of the operations defined with respect to that type of object. The mechanisms provide a coherent basis for extension of the system in two directions: the introduction of new facilities, and the creation of highly secure systems. CACM June, 1974 Wulf, W.

{"id": "CACM-0854", "contents": "Some Characteristics of Sorting in Computing Systems Using Random Access Storage Devices The substantial differences in characteristics of random access storage and tape devices dictate that concepts and objectives of computer program design be considered from the viewpoint of the external file medium used. This is particularly true in the case of sorting. In a tape-oriented system, the major sorting problem is that of minimizing merge time despite the limited orders of merge possible. In contrast, sorting in a random access-oriented system encourages the selection of the optimum order of merge from many possible orders. The latter problem is discussed in this paper, along with criteria developed for determining the optimum order of merge according to the various properties of random access storage devices. Attention is also given to the problem of key sorting versus record sorting and the possibly serious disadvantage of key sorting on a random access system. CACM May, 1963 Hubbard, G. U.

Finally, it is supposed that the problem involves the detection of a large number of combined occurrences for a large number of changes of values of variables. Two efficient solutions for this problem are described. Both methods have the unusual property of being faster for systems where the sum P1 + ... + Pn is larger.

{"id": "CACM-2669", "contents": "A Simple Linear Model of Demand Paging Performance Predicting the performance of a proposed automatically managed multilevel memory system requires a model of the patterns by which programs refer to the information stored in the memory. Some recent experimental measurements on the Multics virtual memory suggest that, for rough approximations, a remarkably simple program reference model will suffice. The simple model combines the effect of the information reference pattern with the effect of the automatic management algorithm to produce a single, composite statement: the mean number of memory references between paging exceptions increases linearly with the size of the paging memory. The resulting model is easy to manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse problems as choosing an optimum size for a paging memory, arranging for reproducible memory usage charges, and estimating the amount of core memory sharing.

{"id": "CACM-2265", "contents": "A Model for Type Checking Most current programming languages treat computation over different classes of objects (e.g. numbers, strings, labels and functions). For correct compilation and execution, the following question then arises: is a program properly constructed so that its operations and operands are compatible? The activity of answering this question is usually called type checking. This paper attempts to isolate the notion of type checking and presents a partial solution to the type checking problem based on the notions of abstraction and application of functions. In particular, a program is mapped into an expression within a decidable subset of the Lambda calculus, which characterizes the type relations within the program and eliminates all other information. The determination of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding Lambda calculus expression to one of two normal forms, the constant \"correct\" for a type-wise correct program or the constant \"error\". An application to type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant problems faced for any notion of type checking are discussed. CACM November, 1972 Ledgard, H.

Teaching someone how to program is similar to teaching him to play a musical instrument: neither skill can be taught-they must be learned. However, the teacher still serves several vital purposes: to present a set of rules for producing well-formed utterances; to offer numerous demonstrations of his own skill; and to function as an involved critic. Finally, the teacher is the source of information about the process in which the student is involved. CACM July, 1973 Rosin, R.

Structured programs are identified as compound function expressions in the algebra of functions. The algebraic properties of these function expressions permit the reformulation (expansion as well as reduction) of a nested subexpression independently of its environment, thus modeling what is known as stepwise program refinement as well as program execution. Finally, structured programming is characterized in terms of the selection and solution of certain elementary equations defined in the algebra of functions. These solutions can be given in general formulas, each involving a single parameter, which display the entire freedom available in creating correct structured programs. CACM January, 1975 Mills, H.

Various modes of partitioning are defined for different types of arrays, so that subarrays may vary over the original array in a nearly arbitrary manner.

This consists of dynamic tree structures which are used to derive and maintain the array control information.

This paper discusses some of these problems, and suggests an alternative approach to display system design which avoids the use of structured display files. This technique employs display procedures to generate information for display. By including transformations within calls to these procedures it is possible both to simplify the specification of pictures and to speed up their generation. Display procedures permit picture elements to be defined conditionally and also facilitate the processing of inputs from pointing devices.

Because of the anticipatory nature of the I/O scheduling, these algorithms are restricted to classes of programs with predictable behavior. While the methods are not restricted to numerical computations, matrix and partial differential equation methods are typical examples of their use.

Classical implementations of list processing systems lack this property because allocating a list cell from the heap may cause a garbage collection, which process requires time proportional to the heap size to finish. A real-time list processing system is presented which continuously reclaims garbage, including directed cycles, while linearizing and compacting the accessible cells into contiguous locations to avoid fragmenting the free storage pool. The program is small and requires no time-sharing interrupts, making it suitable for microcode. Finally, the system requires the same average time, and not more than twice the space, of a classical implementation, and those space requirements can be reduced to approximately classical proportions by compact list representation. Arrays of different sizes, a program stack, and hash linking are simple extensions to our system, and reference counting is found to be inferior for many applications. CACM April, 1978 Baker, H.

Based on the properties of this community we have postulated a hypothetical \"virtual console.\" No claim is made that a virtual console behaves like any actual console, but the entire collection of virtual consoles models the collection of actual consoles. Using the model we answer questions like: How many processes are suspended waiting for console input? What is the maximum rate at which a process can execute? What bounds can be set on overall buffer requirements? Answers to these and similar questions are needed in certain aspects of operating system design. CACM September, 1968 Denning, P.

Initially, a closed system consisting of a process or and paging and file devices, with fixed numbers of jobs, is studied to determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the proportion of processor time devoted to each class. Applying a decomposition approach and treating the closed system as a single server, the response times in an open system with external arrivals are studied. The object is to investigate the effect of the memory alocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms. Numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for the expected response times as functions of the control parameters are obtained.

{"id": "CACM-1029", "contents": "A Simple Automatic Derivative Evaluation Program A procedure for automatic evaluation of total/partial derivatives of arbitrary algebraic functions is presented. The technique permits computation of numerical values of derivatives without developing analytical expressions for the derivatives. The key to the method is the decomposition of the given function, by introduction of intermediate variables, into a series of elementary functional steps. A library of elementary function subroutines is provided for the automatic evaluation and differentiation of these new variables. The final step in this process produces the desired function's derivative. The main feature of this approach is its simplicity. It can be used as a quick-reaction tool where the derivation of analytical derivatives is laborious and also as a debugging tool for programs which contain derivatives. CACM August, 1964 Wengert, R.

The access time of this storage is similar to the cycle time of the machine (50-100 nsec). This microstorage is used to contain both data and subroutines. The (micro) instructions in such a processor differ from the conventional in that they perform only purely combinatorial operations; sequencing is under the control of the microinstruction. The presence of the read-write microstorage permits a more flexible assignment of resources than the read-only storage. In particular, the processor developed in this paper stresses the simultaneous operation (within the microinstruction) of the adder, shifter, masker, and testing facilities of the processor. A microassembly language is developed and the overhead involved in subroutine linkages is analyzed. The efficiency of a flexible software linkage scheme is examined as to its overhead for various subroutine characteristics. Finally, three examples of problem-oriented programming are considered and the resulting coding is compared against a System/360 assembly language version, with the technology normalized.

By using an extension of traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy, five significant improvements to current techniques are possible. First, the range of complexity of an environment is greatly increased while the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within a fixed upper limit. Second, a meaningful way is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a scene. Third, \"clipping\" becomes a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within the field of view. Fourth, frame to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical \"working set,\" or fraction of the total structure that should be present in primary store for immediate access by the visible surface algorithm. Finally, the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent, visible surface algorithm in which the computation time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.

This improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility of the structure, and therefore updating costs are increased.

{"id": "CACM-2569", "contents": "Computer Generation of Gamma Random Variates with Non-integral Shape Parameters When the shape parameter, a, is integral, generating gamma random variables with a digital computer is straightforward. There is no simple method for generating gamma random variates with non-integral shape parameters. A common procedure is to approximately generate such random variables by use of the so-called probability switch method. Another procedure, which is exact, is due to Johnk. This paper presents a rejection method for exactly generating gamma random variables when a is greater than 1. The efficiency of the rejection method is shown to be better than the efficiency of Johnk's method. The paper concludes that when a is non-integral the following mix of procedures yields the best combination of accuracy and efficiency: (1) when a is less than 1, use Johnk's method; (2) when 1 is less than a and a is less than 5, use the rejection method; (3) when a is greater than 5, use the probability switch method.

The technique of dynamic verification allows the construction of an operating system which does not make certain decisions improperly even in the presence of a single hardware or software fault. Furthermore, multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only if the faults happen to reinforce each other.

Salary and advancement prospects, however,are not as satisfactory. More than half report a positive attitude toward programmers and programming on the part of their organizations. Turnover among themselves is attributed primarily to poor management-salary is seen as the principal motivating factor in turnover among other programmers. Nature of the work offered and salary are principal determinants in accepting a new job. Programmers are less mobile than expected.

When programs are designed with abstract data types such as sets and lists, programmer time can be saved by automating the process of filling in low-level implementation details. In the past, programming systems have provided only a single general purpose implementation for an abstract type. Thus the programs produced using abstract types were then inefficient in space or time. In this paper a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations for abstract types from a library of implementations is discussed. This process is discussed in detail for an example program. General issues in data structure selection are also reviewed. CACM May, 1978 Low, J.

The algorithm finds a local minimum of F by evaluating the set {Delta F} of the increments corresponding to a certain set of exchanges of two elementshen the exchange corresponding to the least negative increment of {Delta F} is performed. The process is iterated and stopped when the set of the increments is a positive or empty set, which, it is proved, corresponds to a minimum.

{"id": "CACM-2208", "contents": "Storage Utilization in a Memory Hierarchy When Storage Assignment Is Performed by a Hashing Algorithm The utilization of storage is studied in a two-level memory hierarchy. The first storage level, which is the fast store, is divided into a number of storage areas. When an entry is to be filed in the hierarchy, a hashing algorithm will attempt to place the entry into one of these areas. If this particular area is full, then the entry will be placed into the slower second-level store, even though other areas in the first-level store may have space available. Given the N entries have been filed in the entire hierarchy, an expression is derived for the expected number of entries filed in the first-level storehis expression gives a measure of how effectively the first-level store is being used. By means of examples, storage utilization is then studied as a function of the hashing algorithm, the number of storage areas into which the first-level store is divided and the total size of the first-level store.

Since the development of BNF, the definition of the syntax of programming languages has been almost universally associated with context-free requirements. Yet numerous interesting and difficult issues in syntax stem from the context-sensitive requirements, notably the compatibility between the declaration of an identifier and its uses, the correspondence between actual and formal parameters, and issues arising from block structure. This paper explores the use of a formal notation called Production Systems in providing a readable and complete formal definition of syntax.

{"id": "CACM-2289", "contents": "Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems A cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard type interconnection of identical modules (or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of memory and a small amount of combinational logic, and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors in the array. The chief computational advantage offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel processing. In this paper it is shown that cellular arrays are inherently well suited for the solution of many graph problems. For example, the adjacency matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array, and typical row and column operations are readily implemented by simple cell logic. A major challenge in the effective use of cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently serial. In particular, several parallelized algorithms are presented for the solution of certain spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis, and the analysis of many types of networks. These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. Straightforward cellular implementations of the well-known serial algorithms for these problems require about n steps, and noncellular implementations require from n^2 to n^3 steps.

{"id": "CACM-1879", "contents": "A Note on Storage Fragmentation and Program Segmentation The main purpose of this paper is the presentation of some of the results of a series of simulation experiments investigating the phenomenon of storage fragmentation. Two different types of storage fragmentation are distinguished: (1) external fragmentation, namely the loss in storage utilization caused by the inability to make use of all available storage after it has been fragmented into a large number of separate blocks; and (2) internal fragmentation, the loss of utilization caused by rounding up a request for storage, rather than allocating only the exact number of words required. The most striking result is the apparently general rule that rounding up requests for storage, to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks coexisting in storage, causes more loss of storage by increased internal fragmentation than is saved by decreased external fragmentation.

It is noted that there is a simple extension of Church's Lambda notation that deals nicely with these ideas of context manipulation.

The first is similar to the digital Laplacian, but uses the max, rather than the sum, of the x and y second differences. The second uses the difference between the mean and median gray levels in a neighborhood. The outputs obtained from these operators applied to a set of test pictures are compared with each other and with the standard digital Laplacian and gradient. A third operator, which uses the distance between the center and centroid of a neighborhood as an edge value, is also briefly considered; it turns out to be equivalent to one of the standard digital approximations to the gradient.

{"id": "CACM-1543", "contents": "Computer Formulation of the Equations of Motion Using Tensor Notation A means is described for extending the area of application of digital computers beyond the numerical data processing stage and reducing the need for human participation in the formulation of certain types of computer problems. By the use of tensor calculus and a computer language designed to facilitate symbolic mathematical computation, a method has been devised whereby a digital computer can be used to do non-numeric work, that is, symbolic algebraic manipulation and differentiation. To illustrate the techniques involved, a digital computer has been used to derive the equations of motion of a point mass in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system. Since this operation involves a formulation in terms of first- and second-order differential coefficients, it provides a good demonstration of a computer's capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the formulation process which normally precedes the numerical data processing stage. Moreover, this particular problem serves to illustrate the advantages of the mathematical techniques employed. With the program prepared for this purpose the computer will derive the equations of motion in any coordinate system requested by the user.

In conclusion, the impact of theoretical results on the practicing programmer and the importance of one-in, one-out control structures as operational abstractions are discussed.

{"id": "CACM-2247", "contents": "On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving the flexibility ad comprehensibility of a system while allowing the shortening of its development time. The effectiveness of a \"modularization\" is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched. CACM December, 1972 Parnas, D.

The issue is obvious: users of digital computers must choose from available languages or write their own. Substantial costs can occur, particularly in training, implementation and computer time if an inappropriate language is chosenore and more computer simulation languages are being developed: comparisons and evaluations of existing languages are useful for designers and implementers as well as users. The second part is devoted to computer simulation and simulation languages. The computational characteristics of simulation are discussed with special attention being paid to a distinction between continuous and discrete change models. Part III presents a detailed comparison of six simulation languages and packages: SIMSCRIPT, CLP, CSL, GASP, CPSS and SOL. The characteristics of each are summarized in a series of tables. The implications of this analysis for designers of languages, for users, and for implementers are developed. The conclusion of the paper is that the packages now available for computer simulation offer features which none of the more general-purpose packages do and that analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each suggests ways in which both current and future simulation languages and packages can be improved.

The concept of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability of occurrence of a query term in the documents relevant to that query. By relating term accuracy to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the documents of a collection it is possible to give formal proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems that have been used successfully in experimental situations.

The model transferred control to the operating system to execute functions other than teaching, and then recovered control in order to resume teaching. The teaching system (ABAC-II) was written to run under the operating system (IBSYS) for the IBM 7044 Graphic System. Because the teaching system automatically terminated and rescheduled itself, a student studying a course presented at a cathode-ray display terminal could switch readily between student mode and programmer mode. During the latter, the full resources of the operating system (language processors, compilers, library and user's programs) were at his disposal. He could for example, write, assemble, debug, and execute at the terminal a program written in any language processed by the operating system. A course could therefore include text material interleaved with programming problems which the student could solve without leaving the terminal. Exercises in simulation and gaming could also be provided. The implications of a teaching system with this degree of flexibility for industrial and executive training as well as academic education are discussed. In addition, the advantages of this type of system for computer programming and operation are also considered. CACM June, 1967 Engvold, K. J. Hughes, J. L.

{"id": "CACM-2470", "contents": "Fen-An Axiomatic Basis for Program Semantics A formal system is presented which abstracts the notions of data item, function, and relation. It is argued that the system is more suitable than set theory (or its derivatives) for the concise and accurate description of program semantics. It is shown how the system can be used to build composite data types out of simper ones with the operations of rowing, structuring, and uniting. It is also demonstrated that completely new primitive types can be introduced into languages through the mechanism of singleton data types. Both deterministic and nondeterministic functions are shown to be definable in the system. It is described how the local environment can be modeled as a data item and how imperative statements can be considered functions on the environment. The nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced into the system. The technique is contrasted with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y. The questions of local and global environments and of various modes of function calling and parameter passing are touched upon. The theory is applied to the proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics of the assignment, conditional, and iterative statements. An appendix is included which presents in detail the formal system governing webs and fen, the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper. CACM August, 1973 MacLennan, B.

{"id": "CACM-2342", "contents": "Interference Between Communicating Parallel Processes Various kinds of interference between communicating parallel processes have been examined by Dijkstra, Knuth, and others. Solutions have been given for the mutual exclusion problem and associated subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and informal proofs of correctness have been given for these solutions. In this paper a system of parallel processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds from one state S (i.e. a collection of pertinent data values and process configurations) to a next state S' in accordance with a transition rule S --> S'. A set of such rules yields sequences of states, which dictate the system's behavior. The mutual exclusion problem and the associated subproblems are formulated as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or of the existence of certain sequences. A mechanical proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect to any of the interference properties. It is shown how to calculate transition rules from the \"partial rules\" by which the individual processes operate. The formation of partial rules and the calculation of transition rules are both applicable to hardware processes as well as to software processes, and symmetry between processes is not required.

{"id": "CACM-0071", "contents": "Proposal for a Feasible Programming System This paper proposes designing a programming facility (itself involving a digital computer and a program) which will assist the preparation of large-scale real-time programs. This facility is to be capable of preparing programs for any of a variety of machines having characteristics similar to those of the facility's computer. One of the basic assumptions is that there will be enough random-access storage available to avoid the necessity for segmenting a constructed program in any fashion other than a trivial one. While this assumption is somewhat unrealistic, it is intended to provide an opportunity to concentrate on the other aspects of program construction. The programming system should stress the discovery in source program statements of as many errors as possible, before attempting to construct an object program. Among the computer characteristics which are advocated are a program interrupt scheme, a large set of characters, and indirect addressing. CACM August, 1959 Bagley, P. R.

This optimization problem is here shown to be equivalent to the problem of covering the edges of a graph by complete subgraphs with the objective of minimizing the number of complete subgraphs. A relationship between this edge-clique-cover problem and the graph coloring problem is established which allows algorithms for either one of these problems to be constructed from algorithm for the other. As consequences of this relationship, the keyword conflict problem and the edge-clique-cover problem are shown to be NP-complete, and if P=/NP then they do not admit polynomial-time approximation algorithms which always produce solutions within a factor less than 2 from the optimum.

{"id": "CACM-2252", "contents": "A Method for Incrementally Compiling Languages with Nested Statement Structure A method of incremental compilation is presented which applies especially to programming languages in which statements can be nested (such as Algol and PL/I). The method permits editing of the source language using a general purpose text editor, and incremental processing of changes without frequent recompilation of entire routines. The essential points of the method are: (1) the syntax of the language is restricted insof ar as which constructs may occur on lines; (2) an internal data structure (called the skeleton) is maintained to represent the statement structure; (3) the recompilation is partially batched in the sense that recompilation of modified lines does not occur until the last of a set of editing commands has been received; and (4) the parsing and compilation are factored into two parts, that done on individual lines and that done globally to handle the relationships between the lines.

The object of the work is to clarify how the word description can be made precise so that computer algorithms for feature extraction may be obtained; the focus is on the theoretical subject matter. The results consist of a set-theoretic definition of width-at-angle, a theorem relating it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and descriptions of alternate widths. All widths are calculated for an illustrative example; graphical and tabular comparisons are given. Substantial variation in width-at-angle magnitude is found. The principal conclusion is that the set-theoretic width-at-angle is a useful pattern feature when it can be easily computed. Further investigation of the information contained in only part of a width function is recommended for cases where computation of width-at-angle is difficult.

In vital and health records, however, a unique number is generally not preassigned to an individual for purposes of reporting services received to the health department. In order to determine whether different physician reports refer to the same individual, name and other identification must be compared. This is a laborious operation which is subject to various errors because of name misspellings, changes of name upon marriage, and other problems. We are interested in the maintenance of a psychiatric case register in Maryland, where many of the reports from over a hundred psychiatric agencies refer to the same patient. These records must be linked in order to provide unduplicated counts of individuals under care and longitudinal records of psychiatric history.

The widespread use of complex third generation computing systems has led to a much broader concern about the means by which the resources of these systems are allocated among the user community. One means that is suggested more and more frequently is a pricing procedure. In this paper the manner in which one would like to allocate computing resources is considered, and then the extent to which a pricing mechanism fits this mold is discussed. Inasmuch as pricing must serve as a rationing mechanism at times, consideration is given to the means by which prices can be adjusted flexibly in order to make a dynamic allocation of resources. Consideration is also given to the means by which users can be insulated from the harmful effects of frequent price fluctuations. Although the subject of pricing has been given a lot of attention recently, a number of misconceptions persist about its purpose and its operation. An attempt is made to clarify some of these misunderstandings and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of pricing.

This requirement has led to separate programs for each system under investigation. A new program, through utilization of the Wengert differentiation technique, automatically determines the required matrices from specific system equations supplied in subroutine form at execution time, eliminating the need for individualized programs, and presaging the further development of extremely general computer programs.

Although not every diagram is decomposable into a finite number of given base diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level due to a suitable extension of the given set and of the basic mappings defined in it. Two normalization methods of flow diagrams are given. The first has three base diagrams; the second, only two. In the second part of the paper, the second method is applied to the theory of Turing machines. With every Turing machine provided with a two-way half-tape, there is associated a similar machine, doing essentially the same job, but working on a tape obtained from the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares. The new machine belongs to the family, elsewhere introduced, generated by composition and iteration from the two machines L and R.

Analytical, simulation, and statistical performance evaluation tools are employed to investigate the feasibility of a dynamic response time monitor that is capable of providing comparative response time information for users wishing to process various computing applications at some network computing node. The research clearly reveals that sufficient system data are currently obtainable, at least for the five diverse ARPA network systems studied in detail, to describe and predict the response time for network time-sharing systems as it depends on some measure of system activity or load level.

Recursive formulas are obtained for both the mean and the standard deviation of the length of the j-th sequence.

Graspe may be most easily implemented by embedding it in a host language. Emphasis is placed both on Graspe itself and on its method of definition. Commonly, the definition of a language involves definition of the syntactic elements and explanation of the meaning to be assigned them (the semantics). The definition of Graspe here is solely in terms of its semantics; that is, the data structures and operations are defined precisely but without assignment of a particular syntactic representation. Only when the language is implemented is assignment of an explicit syntax necessary. An example of an implementation of Graspe embedded in Lisp is given as an illustration.

The techniques include careful segmentation of system programs, allocation of virtual memory to allow address arithmetic for type determination, and a special algorithm for building reasonably linearized lists.

Influences external to the systems, such as the sequence of problem solution, and programmer and problem characteristics, were specified as design factors in the experiment. Data was obtained for six variables (e.g., programmer time, computer time, elapsed time, etc.) which were considered to be definitive of \"system effectiveness,\" and analysis of variance techniques were employed to estimate system differences in these variables after differences due to the design factors had been eliminated. Statistical analysis of the experimental results provided strong evidence of important system differences, as well as a critique of the experimental design itself with implications for further experimentation.

{"id": "CACM-2033", "contents": "Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors a given set of messages. Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency. The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods. In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to \"catch\" the small fraction of errors associated with new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods. Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.

When sorting on movable arm disks, the number of seeks is equal to the number of input-output operations, and the seek time usually controls the sort time. First some standard terminology is introduced. Then the input buffer allocation method is described, followed by an analysis of the improvement to be expected over more conventional allocation. This analysis makes use of a particular distribution function. An analysis of a completely different distribution is given which yields similar results. This suggests that the results do not depend on a particular distribution function. An optimum output buffer size is also determined. It is concluded that this buffering allocation can significantly reduce the time of merge sorting on movable arm disks when the input data are not random, and that this output buffer allocation should be used whether the data is random or not.

In addition, argument binding is under the control of the programmer, permitting the definition of various methods of argument transmission in the source language itself.

It is thus more general than the previously published heuristic algorithms.

{"id": "CACM-2497", "contents": "Synchronizing Processors with Memory-Content-Generated Interrupts Implementations of the \"Lock-Unlock\" method of synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor system usually require uninterruptable, memory-pause type instructions. An interlock scheme called read-interlock, which does not require memory-pause instructions, has been developed for a dual DEC PDP-10 system with real-time requirements. The read-interlock method does require a special\"read-interlock\" instruction in the repertoire of the processors and a special \"read-interlock\" cycle in the repertoire of the memory modules. When a processor examines a \"lock\" (a memory location) with a read-interlock instruction, it will be interrupted if the lock was already set; examining a lock immediately sets it if it was not already set (this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle). Writing into a lock clears it. Having the processor interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of branching is advantageous if the branch would have resulted in an effective interrupt.

To derive these equations by this method, the user need know only the coordinate transformation equations relating the curvilinear coordinates of interest to an orthogonal Cartesian triad. When this program is used and the coordinate transformation equations are supplied as input, the computer will derive the Navier-Stokes equations and the continuity equation.

Thirteen general features of predicate calculus clauses were created for use in the automatic learning of better evaluation functions for PP. A multiple regression program was used to produce optimal coefficients for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features. Also, automatic data-handling routines were written for passing data between the learning program and the proving program, and for analyzing and summarizing results. Data was generally collected for learning (regression analysis) from the experience of PP. A number of experiments were performed to test the effectiveness and generality of the learning program. Results showed that the learning produced dramatic improvements in the solutions to problems which were in the same domain as those used for collection learning data. Learning was also shown to generalize successfully to domains other than those used for data collection. Another experiment demonstrated that the learning program could simultaneously improve performance on problems in a specific domain and on problems in a variety of domains.

{"id": "CACM-0497", "contents": "Further Remarks on Line Segment Curve-Fitting Using Dynamic Programming In a recent paper, Bellman showed how dynamic programming could be used to determine the solution to a problem previously considered by Stone. The problem comprises the determination, given N, of the N points of subdivision of a given interval (a,B) and the corresponding line segments, that give the best least squares fit to a function g(x) in the interval. Bellman confined himself primarily to the analytical derivation, suggesting briefly, however, how the solution of the equation derived for each particular point of subdivision u(i) could be reduced to a discrete search. In this paper, the computational procedure is considered more fully, and the similarities to some of Stone's equations are indicated. It is further shown that an equation for u(i) involving no minimization may be found.

(The Choice of Decimal or Binary Representation) The binary number system offers many advantages over a decimal representation for a high-performance, general-purpose computer. The greater simplicity of a binary arithmetic unit and the greater compactness of binary numbers both contribute directly to arithmetic speed. Less obvious and perhaps more important is the way binary addressing and instruction formats can increase the overall performance. Binary addresses are also essential to certain powerful operations which are not practical with decimal instruction formats. On the other hand, decimal numbers are essential for communicating between man and the computer. In applications requiring the processing of a large volume of inherently decimal input and output data, the time for decimal-binary conversion needed by a purely binary computer may be significant. A slower decimal adder may take less time than a fast binary adder doing an addition and two conversions. A careful review of the significance of decimal and binary addressing and both binary and decimal data arithmetic, supplemented by efficient conversion instructions. CACM December, 1959 Buchholz, W.

{"id": "CACM-3002", "contents": "A Record and File Partitioning Model One of the main objectives in the design of a file system is the reduction of storage and data transfer costs. This paper presents a model in which several requests access the file system, and each request requires information from one or more variable length data-items. The probabilities of access and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed to be known, and to be mutually independent. The file system uses one or more storage devices, and each record may be partitioned into subrecords that are stored on different devices. One of the subrecords is designated as the primary record; when a request for a record is made, the primary record is first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed only if the pertinent information is not stored in the primary record. The model that is presented in this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and a mixed integer programming model, is a very general one; several types of file systems may be derived from it by an appropriate selection of its parameters. This model has already been used in the optimization of library routines' storage at a large scale operating system. CACM January, 1977 Babad, J.

{"id": "CACM-1846", "contents": "On Simulating Networks of Parallel Processes in Which Simultaneous Events May Occur Some of the problems of simulating discrete event systems, particularly computer systems, on a conventional digital computer are dealt with. The systems are assumed to be described as a network of interconnected sequential processes. Briefly reviewed are the common techniques used to handle such simulations when simultaneous events do not occur, can be ignored, or can be handled by simple priority rules. Following this, the problem of dealing with simultaneous events in separate processes is introduced. An abstraction of this problem is developed which admits solution for a majority of commonly encountered problems. The technique will either find a method of simulating the parallel events or report that none can be found. In some of the latter cases it is shown to be possible to find a solution by extending the information available to the solution technique, but in many cases the technique becomes computationally unfeasible when the additional information is provided.

Student interest in this development is intense and if properly utilized should yield a much better understanding of mathematical concepts as well as the ideas of programming and logical structure which have been introduced into many fields by the use of computers. The present paper suggests that that portion of the undergraduate mathematical curriculum which is preparation for the use of mathematics by persons who are not professional mathematicians be modified to include the extensions and clarifications which are possible because of computers. An early introduction to programming is desirable to permit a continuing use of automatic computation to illustrate and clarify mathematical concepts. Following the calculus equation stage an intensive introduction to numerical analysis should be added to the current curriculum. In addition to providing competence in the mostly used computing techniques, it would permit a more sophisticated utilization of the advanced mathematical ideas associated with complex variables and transform theories.

Instead, CAPS interacts with the student to help him find the cause of his error.

As elsewhere, these universities are experiencing student discontent with the status quo and the solutions they are attempting contrast: Argentina is excluding students from participating in university government; Chile is allowing such participation. University computing service and academic activities are limited. The number of computers is small and so is the capacity, none larger than an IBM 360/40; with some exception, computing science academic programs are rare. This situation is by no means attributable to those responsible for computing developments, who strive for excellence; rather the \"system\" is hard to over-come. Universities, especially those with strong European traditions, adapt slowly to new academic resources and disciplines; superimposed are the severe technological and economic constraints of the developing nation.

{"id": "CACM-2421", "contents": "A Scan Conversion Algorithm with Reduced Storage Requirements Most graphics systems using a raster scan output device (CRT or hardcopy) maintain a display file in the XY or random scan format. Scan converters, hardware or software, must be provided to translate the picture description from the XY format to the raster format. Published scan conversion algorithms which are fast will reserve a buffer area large enough to accommodate the entire screen. On the other hand, those which use a small buffer area are slow because they require multiple passes through the XY display file. The scan conversion algorithm described here uses a linked list data structure to process the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to groups of scan lines. A relatively small primary memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image for a group of scan lines. When this portion of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for the next portion. Because of the list processing procedures used, only a single pass through the XY display file is required when generating the binary image and only a slight increase in execution time over the fully buffered core results. Results slow that storage requirements can be reduced by more than 80 percent while causing less than a 10 percent increase in execution time. CACM November, 1973 Jordan, B. W. Jr. Barrett, R.

The system compares this password with one recorded in a Password Table which is available to only the authentication program. The integrity of the system depends on keeping the table secret. In this paper a password scheme is presented which does not require secrecy in the computer. All aspects of the system, including all relevant code and data bases, may be known by anyone attempting to intrude. The scheme is based on using a function H which the would-be intruder is unable to invert. This function is applied to the user's password and the result compared to a table entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of the user. The intruder may know all about H and have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system only if he can invert H to determine an input that produces a given output. This paper discusses issues surrounding selection of a suitable H. Two different plausible arguments are given that penetration would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then argued that more rigorous results are unlikely. Finally, some human engineering problems relating to the scheme are discussed. CACM August, 1974 Evans, A. Jr. Kantrowitz, W.

It consists in reducing to one level a nonhomogeneous store composed of fast (core) and slow (disk or drum) memories. The space available in slow memory is divided into pages each containing a given number of machine words. The reduction to a one-level memory is performed by a program which leaves the most often called pages in the fast memory. When a new page from slow store is requested, the page in core having the longest period of inactivity is transferred back to the slow store. The complete scheme has been implemented in connection with a LISP embedding into ALGOL, using an IBM 7044 with 32k of core memory and disks. Gains in memory space were about 100-fold. As often happens in programming applications the price of the additional space is computer time. Although the disks have an access time 10^4 times slower than core, tests indicate that the actual slow down varied from 3 to 10, depending on the number of pages available in the fast store.

A program's behavior can be characterized in terms of its residence in localities of various sizes and lifetimes, and the transitions between these localities. In this paper the concept of a locality is made more explicit through a formal definition of what constitutes a phase of localized reference behavior, and by a corresponding mechanism for the detection of localities in actual reference strings. This definition provides for the existence of a hierarchy of localities at any given time, and the reasonableness of the definition is supported by examples taken from actual programs. Empirical data from a sample of production Algol 60 programs is used to display distributions of locality sizes and lifetimes, and these results are discussed in terms of their implications for the modeling of program behavior and memory management in virtual memory systems.

The objective is to find a transformed digital picture of a given picture such that the sum of absolute errors between the gray level his togram of the transformed picture and that of a reference picture is minimized. This is equivalent to placing k1 linearly ordered objects of different sized one by one into k2 linearly ordered boxes of assorted sizes, such that the accumulated error of space under packed or overpacked in the boxes is minimized; the placement function is monotonic, which ensures a polynomial time solution to this problem. A tree search algorithm for optimal his togram matching is presented which has time complexity O(k1 x k2). If the monotone property is dropped, then the problem becomes NP-complete, even if it is restricted to k2 = 2. CACM October, 1978 Chang, S. Wong, Y.

Not only is it necessary to develop an appropriate hardware configuration for these systems, but appropriate software adjustments must be made. Unfortunately, these systems often do not respond to changes in the manner that intuition would suggest, and there are few guides to assist in the analysis of performance characteristics. The development of a comprehensive simulation model to assist in the investigation of these questions is described in this paper. The resulting model has a general purpose design and can be used to study a variety of time-sharing systems. It can also be used to assist in the design and development of new time-sharing algorithms or techniques. For the sake of efficiency and greater applicability, the model was implemented in a limited FORTRAN subset that is compatible with most FORTRAN IV compilers.

{"id": "CACM-2499", "contents": "Efficient Multiprogramming Resource Allocation and Accounting Although sometimes thought of as only a component of time-sharing operation, multiprogramming can involve broader questions of resource allocation, since fairness is not required to meet a response criterion. In a multiprogrammed system, it may serve maximal resource use to be unfair, for example by holding an input/output channel idle for a program while it completes a small amount of processor usage, enabling further use of the channel. Several applications of this principle are given, and it is suggested that a multiprogramming executive might dynamically adjust its allocation algorithms to gain efficiency. Allocation of resources is closely connected to accounting for those resources, raising the problems of repeatability, minimal uncharged overhead, and relative weighting of charges for dependent resources. Since weightings may depend on allocation algorithms, these are not arbitrary accounting parameters. Often the only repeatable accounting is one which omits an extensive overhead will be paid, and should multiprogramming prove efficient, overcharges will result. Multiprogramming turns on allocation of the memory resource essential to control of other resources. The general suggestions for allocation and accounting are applied to this question, and some details provided for the case of a monitor which controls a virtual-memory machine.

{"id": "CACM-3157", "contents": "Proving Termination with Multiset Orderings A common tool for proving the termination of programs is the well-founded set, a set ordered in such a way as to admit no infinite descending sequences. The basic approach is to find a termination function that maps the values of the program variables into some well-founded set, such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced throughout the computation. All too often, the termination functions required are difficult to find and are of a complexity out of proportion to the program under consideration. Multisets (bags) over a given well-founded set S are sets that admit multiple occurrences of elements taken from S. The given ordering on S induces an ordering on the finite multisets over S. This multiset ordering is shown to be well-founded. The multiset ordering enables the use of relatively simple and intuitive termination functions in otherwise difficult termination proofs. In particular, the multiset ordering is used to prove the termination of production systems, programs defined in terms of sets of rewriting rules. CACM August, 1979 Dershowitz, N. Manna, Z.

This capability is provided through parse-requests stated in a BNF-like format. These parse-requests form their own programming language with special sequencing rules. Upon successfully completing a parse-request, an associated piece of PL/I code is executed. This code has available for use, as normal PL/I strings the various pieces (at all levels) of the parse. It also has available as normal PL/I variables, the information concerning which of the various alternatives were successful. Convenient facilities for multiple input-output streams, the initiation of sequences of parse-requests as a subroutine, and parse-time semantic checks are also included.

This procedure makes use of a sentence recognition device for the class of grammars which will correctly decide between the grammatical and ungrammatical sentences of a natural language. It is possible to make use of a recognition device of this sort for the following reason: Much data is fully expressible as a set of sentences in a natural language, a set which can be exhaustively and exclusively generated by a grammar. Based upon the rules of this grammar, a sentence recognizer will evaluate sentences, questions in the normal situation. Since the recognition function succeeds just in case the posed question is drawn from the set of sentences expressing the data, or, more correctly, is grammatical in terms of the grammar for this set of sentences, sentence recognition itself is a procedure for retrieving information. When the recognition function succeeds, its value represents the requested information. CACM October, 1967 Rosenbaum, P.

An encoding scheme is described which produces a single, order-preserving string from a sequence of strings.

The strings may be variable length, without a maximum length restriction, and no symbols need be reserved for control purposes. Hence any symbol may occur in any string.

Some conclusions drawn in the article are: (1) DEDUCOM can answer a wide variety of questions. (2) A human can increase the deductive power of DEDUCOM by telling it more facts. (3) DEDUCOM can write very simple programs (it is hoped that this ability is the forerunner of an ability to self-program, which is a way to learn). (4)DEDUCOM's search procedure at present has two bad defects: some questions answerable from the given facts cannot be answered and some other answerable questions can be answered only if the relevant facts are given in the \"right\" order. (6) At present, DEDUCOM's method of making logical deductions in predicate calculus has two bad defects: some facts have to be changed to logically equivalent ones before being given to DEDUCOM, and some redundant facts have to be given to DEDUCOM.

{"id": "CACM-2697", "contents": "A Fast Method for Solving a Class of Tridiagonal Linear Systems The solution of linear systems having real, symmetric, diagonally dominant,tridiagonal coefficient matrices with constant diagonals is considered. It is proved that the diagonals of the LU decomposition converges when floating-point precision. It is also proved that the computed LU decomposition converges when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limits of the LU diagonals using floating point are roughly within machine precision of the limits using real arithmetic. This fact is exploited to reduce the number of floating-point operations required to solve a linear system from 8n-7 to 5n+2k-3, where k is much less than n, the order of the matrix. If the elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals are 1, then only 4n+2k-3 operations are needed. The entire LU decomposition takes k words of storage, and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved. Upper and lower bounds on k are obtained in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonal constants and parameters of the floating-point number system. Various generalizations of these results are discussed. CACM January, 1974 Malcolm, M. A.

The principal advantage of the WATFOR compiler is that it translates FORTRAN IV programs at speeds of up to 100 statements per second. Since the compiler resides core there is virtually no system overhead, and hence large batches of \"student\" programs may be processed very efficiently. The compiler also provides extensive error diagnostics, during both the compilation and the execution phases of a program run.

The modification is shown to be more stable computationally than the traditional Ritz approach. The first concern of the paper is to describe the algorithm and establish its properties as a valid and useful numerical technique. In particular such useful properties as definiteness and reasonableness of condition are established for the method. The second part of the paper is devoted to a comparison of the new techniques with the standard procedure of numerically integrating a matrix Riccati equation to determine a feedback matrix.

The optimal joining policy is one of arriving users who may join the system at some of its queues is a control limit policy, with a single control number for any possible queue and the user's class; a newly arriving user will join a queue that is not filled up to the control number corresponding to this queue and the user's class.

In attempting to solve these linear programming models, using IBM's MPS package, instances of cycling were encountered. Small perturbations in the input data resulted in problems which did not cycle. This fact, plus several other observed phenomena suggest that the primary reason that cycling is not known to occur more frequently is the round-off errors in the computations perturb the problem sufficiently to prevent cycling (or at least to prevent indefinite cycling). In one case maximizing and minimizing an objective function subject to the same constrain t set was attempted, but MPS solved only one of these while giving an indication of infeasibility for the other.

{"id": "CACM-1350", "contents": "The Augmented Predictive Analyzer for Context-Free Languages-Its Relative Efficiency It has been proven by Greibach that for a given context-free grammar G, a standard-form grammar Gs can be constructed, which generates the same languages as is generated by G and whose rules are all of the form Z --> cY(1) ... Y(m), (m >= O) where Z and Y(i) are intermediate symbols and c a terminal symbol. Since the predictive analyzer at Harvard uses a standard-form grammar, it can accept the language of any context-free Grammar G, given an equivalent standard-form grammar Gs. The structural descriptions SD(Gs,X) assigned to a given sentence X by the predictive analyzer, however, are usually different from the structural descriptions SD(G,X) assigned to the same sentence by the original context-free grammar G from which Gs is derived. In Section 1, an algorithm, originally due to Abbott is described standard-form grammar each of whose rules is in standard form, supplemented by additional information describing its derivation from the original context-free grammar. A technique for performing the SD(Gs,X) to SD(G,X) transformation effectively is also described. In section 2, the augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing algorithm for arbitrary context-free languages is compared with two other parsing algorithms: a selective top-to-bottom algorithm similar to Irons' \"error correcting parse algorithm\" and an immediate constituent analyzer which is an extension of Sakai-Cocke's algorithm for normal grammars. The comparison is based upon several criteria of efficiency, covering core-storage requirements, complexities of the programs and processing time. CACM November, 1966 Kuno,S.

These processors are capable of recognizing and parsing an input during a single no-backup scan in a number of steps equal to the length of the input plus the number of steps in its derivation. The technique presented here is based on the original method described by Knuth, but decreases both the effort required to construct the processor and the size of the processor produced. This procedure involves partitioning the given grammar into a number of smaller parts. If an LR(k) processor can be constructed for each part (using Knuth's algorithm) and if certain conditions relating these individual processors are satisfied, then an LR(k) processor for the entire grammar can be constructed for them. Using this procedure, an LR(1) parser for ALGOL has been obtained. CACM November, 1969 Korenjak, A. J.

The fundamental idea is to add a column (or row) analogous to adding an additional row of data in a linear least squares problem. A column (or row) is dropped by a formal scaling with the imaginary unit, -1, followed by least squares addition of the column (or row). The elimination process for the procedure is successive ssive application of the Givens transformation in modified (more efficient) form. These ideas are illustrated with an implementation of the revised simplex method. The algorithm is a general purpose one that does not account for any particular structure or sparsity in the equations. Some suggested computational tests for determining signs of various controlling parameters in the revised simplex algorithm are mentioned.

{"id": "CACM-1197", "contents": "Finding Zeros of a Polynomial by the Q-D Algorithm A method which finds simultaneously all the zeros of a polynomial, developed by H. Rutishauser, has been tested on a number of polynomials with real coefficients. This slowly converging method (the Quotient-Difference (Q-D) algorithm) provides starting values for a Newton or a Bairstow algorithm for more rapid convergence. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the Q-D scheme are not completely known; however, failure may occur when zeros have equal, or nearly equal magnitudes. Success was achieved, in most of the cases tried, with the failures usually traceable to the equal magnitude difficulty. In some cases, computer roundoff may result in errors which spoil the scheme. Even if the Q-D algorithm does not give all the zeros, it will usually find a majority of them. CACM September, 1965 Henrich, P. Watkins, B. O.

An assignment algorithm is then executed in order to minimize the total number of temporary storage cells required to hold the results of evaluating the factors. In order to make these techniques computationally feasible, heuristic procedures are applied, and hence global optimal results are not necessarily generated. The factorization algorithms are also applicable to the problem of factoring Boolean switching expressions and of factoring polynomials encountered in symbol manipulating systems.

This paper shows how to extend programming languages to provide controlled sharing. The extension permits expression of access constraints on shared data. Access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and to objects that are components of larger objects, such as bank account records in a bank's data base. The constraints are stated declaratively, and can be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.

{"id": "CACM-1135", "contents": "A General Business-Oriented Language Based on Decision Expressions* The structure of a digital compute programming language which covers a wide class of business and file processing applications is presented. Such a structure, based on identifying and incorporating into a compiler the aspects common to all processes of such class, permits writing extremely compact programs, even for comparatively complex applications, in terms of tables of control expressions which express only information characteristic of the particular application. Furthermore,local changes of a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output files involved) can be effected by local modifications in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the tables). This structure also allows for inexpensive preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the source programs into efficient machine codes. The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical language design philosophies. It stresses the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions. It relies exclusively on nonprocedural representation of process as sets (tables) of relations between data and results (there are no control statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure descriptions (which are one-to-one translations of flowcharts). Here an invariant pattern of procedure is identified as characteristic of the class of all batch file processes. This new philosophy has the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies of other business-oriented languages and fully meets the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, including machine-independence.

A simple extension has been found to the conventional orthogonalization method for inverting non-singular matrices, which gives the generalized inverse with little extra effort and with no additional storage requirements. The algorithm gives the generalized inverse for any m by n matrix A, including the special case when m+n and A is non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(A) = n.

{"id": "CACM-2786", "contents": "A System for Typesetting Mathematics This paper describes the design and implementation of a system for typesetting mathematics. The language has been designed to be easy to learn and to use by people (for example, secretaries and mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor typesetting. Experience indicates that the language can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules and fewer exceptions. For typical expressions, the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and the like necessary to print according to mathematical conventions are all done automatically. For example, the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 2 produces (formula). The syntax of the language is specified by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler is used to make a compiler that translates this language into typesetting commands. Output maybe produced on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward and reverse half-line motions. The system interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled simply.

{"id": "CACM-0533", "contents": "Digital Synthesis of Correlated Stationary Noise In this note we propose a method of generating stationary noise with a prescribed auto-covariance function by digital methods. The need for such a technique often arises in testing the performance of data processing and engineering systems, where inputs corrupted with correlated noise (of a known form) are required. The technique is quite simple and produces strict-sense stationary noise which agrees approximately with R(t), the prescribed auto-covariance function (acf), over an interval [-T(0), T(0)]. The method consists of approximating the spectral density by a periodic process with spectral lines, and then synthesizing the periodic noise with random phases and appropriate amplitudes. In order to simplify discussion of the statistical properties of the noise generated, the technique is first presented in terms of exact harmonic analysis. In practice, discrete harmonic analysis as presented in the third section is used. CACM July, 1962 Peabody, P. R. Adorno, D. S. CA620728 JB March 17, 1978 7:59 PM 533 5 533 533 5 533 533 5 533\n"}

It is based on the principle that it is desirable to have many options when making decisions in the face of uncertainty. The mini-max procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node the value of the highest (lowest) valued successor to that node. The M & N procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node some function of the M (N) highest (lowest) valued successors. An M & N procedure was written in LISP to play the game of kalah, and it was demonstrated that the M & N procedure is significantly superior to the mini-max procedure. The statistical significance of important conclusions is given. Since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field, these experiments can perhaps serve as a model for future work.

Several objectives merit consideration in optimizing a decision table:(1) reducing machine execution time; (2) reducing preprocessing time; (3) reducing required machine memory; (4) reducing the number of decision rules. (This often improves the clarity of the decision table to a human reader.) It will be shown that objectives (3) and (4) can be furthered with the above methods.

Embeddings of graphs are used to model the loss of proximity involved in such storage schemes, and an elementary proof that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with bounded loss of proximity is presented. Average loss of proximity is then considered, and it is shown that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with only bounded loss of average proximity, but can be so stored in binary trees.

{"id": "CACM-3094", "contents": "Analyses of Deterministic Parsing Algorithms This paper describes an approach for determining the minimum, maximum, and average times to parse sentences acceptable by a deterministic parser. These quantities are presented in the form of symbolic formulas, called time-formulas. The variables in these formulas represent not only the length of the input string but also the time to perform elementary operations such as pushing, popping, subscripting, iterating, etc. By binding to the variables actual numerical values corresponding to a given compiler-machine configuration, one can determine the execution time for that configuration. Time-formulas are derived by examining the grammar rules and the program representing the algorithm one wishes to analyze. The approach is described by using a specific grammar that defines simple arithmetic expressions. Two deterministic parsers are analyzed: a top-down recursive descent LL(1) parser, and a bottom-up SLR(1) parser. The paper provides estimates for the relative efficiencies of the two parsers.

{"id": "CACM-1725", "contents": "A Simple Proof of Lewin's Ordered-Retrieval Theorem for Associative Memories An efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary words from an associative memory, as described by Lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits which indicate the digit values present in the individual digit columns of the memory. Thus the circuits indicate whether the individual digit columns contain digits of both values, or of only one value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the memory is empty). The use of these circuits, which in this paper are termed column value indicators, reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary to retrieve in order a number of distinct words from the memory. Lewin proves that, for the readout by the described method of m distinct binary words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary. (Thus he proves that the number of necessary memory accesses of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent of the word length.) In this paper a very simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary aspects of the structure of sets of binary numbers is presented.

The proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity of the nondeterministic formulation of search processes on one level (the attempt level), deferring the coordination of problem solving efforts to another (the choice level). The feasibility of recognizing these two levels is discussed, stressing that the structure to be managed at the choice level is a free of contexts. The leaves are computational environments, each holding an alternative under inspection, while the other nodes are associated with choice poin ts. According to the proposed programming style, a generative function is associated with each choice poin t, which expresses the desired choice strategy. The main advantage on this approach is the localization of the search strategies: Each nonterminal node of the tree keeps track of the state of the computation as it was when the choice poin t was last interrogated, holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate the available alternatives. Examples are given in term of ND-Lisp, an extension of Lisp designed and implemented according to these guidelines. CACM October, 1977 Montangero, C. Pacini, G.

Rules on redundancy, contradiction, and completeness for limited entry tables were published in 1963. These are usually used for checking, preceded if necessary by a conversion from extended to limited entry form. Processors which automatically translate tables to more conventional program usually base their diagnostic facilities on these rules. In this paper it is suggested that these rules are unsatisfactory and that the important aspect of checking is to eliminate ambiguity from tables. Ambiguity is defined and discussed, and a procedure for producing checked-out decision tables is proposed. The theoretical basis of the algorithm used is established.

It has an advantage over the more general AVL tree in that only one bit of balancing information is required (two bits are required for the ACL tree). It is shown that deletion of an arbitrary node of such a tree can be accomplished in O(logn) operations, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Moreover the method is optimal in the sense that its complexity cannot be reduced in order of magnitude. This result, coupled with earlier results by Hirschberg, indicates that, of the three basic problems of insertion, deletion, and retrieval, only insertion is adversely affected by this modification of an AVL tree.

{"id": "CACM-1665", "contents": "Automatic Generation of Efficient Lexical Processors Using Finite State Techniques The practical application of the theory of finite-state automata to automatically generate lexical processors is dealt with in this tutorial article by the use of the AED RWORD system, developed at M. as part of the AED-1 system. This system accepts as input description of the multicharacter items or of words allowable in a language given in terms of a subset of regular expressions. The output of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string of characters and combines them into the items as defined by the regular expressions. Each output item is identified by a code number together with a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters and character count in the item. The processors produced by the system are based on finite-state machines. Each state of a \"machine\" corresponds to a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character string. At each state a character is read, and the machine changes to a new state. At each transition appropriate actions are taken based on the particular character read. The system has been in operation since 1966, and processors generated have compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs to accomplish the same task. Lexical processors for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been produced. The techniques employed are independent of the nature of the items being evaluated. If the word \"events\" is substituted for character string, these processors may be described as generalized decision-making mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence of events. This allows the system to be used in a range of applications outside the area of lexical processing. However convenient these advantages may be, speed is the most important consideration. In designing a system for automatic generation of a lexical processor, the goal was a processor which completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly as fast as hand-coded processors, which would analyze the language and detect errors, and which would be convenient and easy to use.

For identification of information the paper suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed in a paper by Goffman, Verhoeff and Belzer) associated with an object language be used. For searching strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function of relevancy is developed which rewards the system for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the escaped relevant documents and false drops. The inadequacies of a linear model are indicated. Two approaches to file organization are discussed. One is self-organization of the file based on its history and past performance, and the second is a self-generating subset of the file with a high probability of being relevant.

Aggregation transforms a relationship between objects into a higher-level object. A new data type, called aggregation, is developed which, under certain criteria of \"well-definedness,\" specifies aggregation abstractions. Relational databases defined as collections of aggregates are structured as a hierarchy on n-ary relations. To main tain well-definedness, update operations on such databases must preserve two invariants. Well-defined relations are distinct from relations in third normal form. It is shown that these notions are complementary and both are important in database design. A top-down methodology for database design is described which separates decisions concerning aggregate structure from decisions concerning key identification. It is suggested that aggregate types, and other types which support real-world abstractions without in troducing implementation detail, should be incorporated into programming languages.

The method is a synthesis of spline theory and algorithms, an in teractive means for man-machine communication, and software for static or dynamic graphics display. The basic technique employed is a modified lofting method on which sectional curves are represented by uniform B-splines and the surface is in terpolated between sections by Cardinal splines. Among the features of this method are algorithms which enable in teractive modification of the B-spline representation of the sectional curves. At all stages of the process, the spatial information is graphically displayed to the user. Complex surfaces can be created by the combination of a number of shapes that have been separately generated and automatically joined. The system has been successfully in terfaced to a variety of analytical routines for structural, medical and graphical applications. CACM October, 1977 Wu, Sheng-Chuan Abel, J. F. Greenberg, D.

Algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in this manner are presented and analyzed to determine sufficient conditions under which the list processor never needs to wait on the collector. These techniques are shown to require at most twice as much processing power as regular garbage collectors, if they are used efficiently. The average behavior of the program is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case performance, so that the sufficient conditions are also suitable for measuring the typical behavior of the algorithm.

The machine, although small, aids program design by providing display scope and premarked randomly addressable LINC tapes as standard items, in an environment similar to that of a sophisticated terminal. The tapes are logically similar to a disk. Priority was given to the design of efficient tape algorithms to minimize the limitations of the small memory.

{"id": "CACM-2829", "contents": "Texture and Reflection in Computer Generated Images In 1974 Catmull developed a new algorithm for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. This paper describes extensions of this algorithm in the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. The parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate system which is used as a key for mapping patterns onto the surface. The intensity of the pattern at each picture element is computed as a weighted average of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape and size of this weighting function are chosen using digital signal processing theory. The patch rendering algorithm allows accurate computation of the surface normal to the patch at each picture element, permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections.

This paper discusses a simulation model of a data retrieval system which has the effect of significantly reducing the cost of experimentation and enabling research never attempted before. The model is designed to estimate the retrieval workload of alternative data retrieval systems. These data retrieval systems can be organized under several database organizations, including inverted list, threaded list, and cellular list organizations and hybrid combinations of these systems. Effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated by using the model to study the effect of database organizations in data retrieval systems. In particular, the impact of query complexity is analyzed.

Each class of users can be characterized by a policy function which specifies the amount of service a user who belongs to this class should receive as a function of time. Priority changes dynamically as a function of the difference between the service promised to the user by the policy function and the service he actually receives. A scheduling and swapping algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process above its policy function will provide the specified level of service. Overhead can be reduced by avoiding swaps of process which have received at least his level of service.

For simpler material, for instance the \"claims\" sections of patents, and in applications where the utmost accuracy is not necessary, an unsupervised mode is advocated. Here, the textual portions of the page are located during a rapid prescan by a rudimentary form of frequency analysis. These areas are then rescanned at a higher resolution suitable for character recognition.

The disadvantages of prefolding, which is required when the folding is manual, are examined, and a number of the important troubles which beset computing today are shown to arise from, or be aggravated by, this source.

The bits iin the shift registers are numbered 0 to N - 1, and blocks of N bits are always transferred, always starting at bit 0. What is the best shift strategy so that a block transfer request occurring at a random time will have to wait the minimal amount of time before bit 0 can be reached? The minimum shift rate requirement does not allow one to simply \"park\" at bit 0 and wait for a transfer request. The optimal strategy involves shifting as slowly as possible until bit 0 is passed, then shifting as quickly as possible until a critical boundary is reached, shortly before bit 0 comes around again. This is called the \"hurry up and wait\" strategy and is well known outside the computer field.

{"id": "CACM-2734", "contents": "On the External Storage Fragmentation Produced by First-Fit and Best-Fit Allocation Strategies Published comparisons of the external fragmentation produced by first-fit and best-fit memory allocation have not been consistent. Through simulation, a series of experiments were performed in order to obtain better data on the relative performance of first-fit and best-fit and a better understanding of the reasons underlying observed differences. The time-memory-product efficiencies of first-fit and best-fit were generally within 1 to 3 percent of each other. Except for small populations, the size of the request population had little effect on allocation efficiency. For exponential and hyperexponential distributions of requests, first-fit outperformed best-fit; but for normal and uniform distributions, and for exponential distributions distorted in various ways, best-fit outperformed first-fit. It is hypothesized that when first-fit outperforms best-fit, it does so because first-fit, by preferentially allocating toward one end of memory, encourages large blocks to grow at the other end. Sufficient contiguous space is thereby more likely to be available for relatively large requests. Results of simulation experiments supported this hypothesis and showed that the relative performance of first-fit and best-fit depends on the frequency of request. When the coefficient of variation of the request distribution is greater than or approximately equal to unity, first-fit outperformed best-fit. CACM August, 1975 Shore, J.

{"id": "CACM-2931", "contents": "Logic and Programming Languages Logic has been long in terested in whether answers to certain questions are computable in principle, since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of formalization. More recently, precise comparisons in the efficiency of decision methods have become available through the developments in complexity theory. These, however, are applications to logic, and a big question is whether methods of logic have significance in the other direction for the more applied parts of computability theory. Programming languages offer an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization is well advanced; however, the semantical theory can hardly be said to be complete. Though we have many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging mathematical answers to these queries: What is a machine? What is a computable process? How (or how well) does a machine simulate a process? Programs naturally enter in giving descriptions of processes. The definition of the precise meaning of a program then requires us to explain what are the objects of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem) and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). So far the theories of automata and of nets, though most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic aspects. It would seem that the understanding of higher-level program features involves us with infinite objects and forces us to pass through several levels of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to the final simulation on a real machine. These levels can be made mathematically exact if we can find the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures. The experience of many independent workers with the method of data types as lattices (or partial orderings) under an information content ordering, and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the flexibility of this approach in providing definitions and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence on implementations. Nevertheless much remains to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say we have a unified theory. CACM September, 1977 Scott, D.

These systems promise both financial benefits for the institutions that use them and potential conveniences to their customers. However, they also raise significant social, legal, and technical questions that must be resolved if full scale systems for Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) are not to cause more problems for the larger public than they solve. This paper examines the incentives for EFT developments and the social problems they raise in the context of conflicts between five different value positions that are often implicit in analyses of proposed EFT arrangements. These conflicts reflect the relative importance of certain problems for specific groups. The value positions implicit in EFT proposals help to organize analyses of market arrangements, system reliability, and privacy of transactions. These topics are analyzed in this article and related to the value positions held by concerned parties. Last, the ways in which the public can learn about the social qualities of different EFT arrangements and the pace of EFT developments are both discussed in the context of social choice.

A formal parsing system G = (V,u,T,R) consists of two finite disjoint vocabularies, V and T, a many-many map, u, from V onto T, and a recursive set R of strings in T called syntactic sentence classes. Every program for automatic syntactic analysis determines a formal parsing system. A directed production analyzer (I,T,X,p) is a nondeterministic pushdown-store machine with internal vocabulary I, input vocabulary T, and all productions of p in the form: (Z,a) -> aY1 ... Ym where Z, Yi are elements of the set I and a is an element of the set T. Every context-free language can be analyzed by a directed production analyzer. The Kuno-Oettinger multiple-path syntactic analyzer for English is a concrete example of a directed production analyzer and of a working parsing algorithm. The connection between structures assigned by the analyzer and those of a conventional phrase structure grammar is examined in this paper. CACM August, 1964 Greibach, S. A.

The real workload is characterized by its demands on the various system resources. These characteristics of the real workload are obtained from the system accounting data. The characteristics of the drive workload are determined by matching the joint probability density of the real workload with that of the drive workload. The drive workload is realized by using a synthetic program in which the characteristics can be varied by varying the appropriate parameters. Calibration experiments are conducted to determine expressions relating the synthetic program parameters with the workload characteristics. The general method is applied to the case of two variables, cpu seconds and number of I/O activities; and synthetic workload with 88 jobs is constructed to represent a month's workload consisting of about 6000 jobs.

{"id": "CACM-2320", "contents": "Structured Multiprogramming This paper presents a proposal for structured representation of multiprogramming in a high level language. The notation used explicitly associates a data structure shared by concurrent processes with operations defined on it. This clarifies the meaning of programs and permits a large class of time-dependent errors to be caught at compile time. A combination of critical regions and event variables enables the programmer to control scheduling of resources among competing processes to any degree desired. These concepts are sufficiently safe to use not only within operating systems but also within user programs. CACM July, 1972 Hansen, P.

The scheme, which is based on LR parsing, is driven by information which is directly and automatically obtainable from the information that is already present in an LR parser. The approach, which is patterned after that of Levy and Graham and Rhodes, appears to provide error recovery which is both simple and powerful. CACM June, 1978 Mickunas, M. Modry, J.
