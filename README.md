Pyserini is a Python toolkit for reproducible information retrieval research with sparse and dense representations.
Retrieval using sparse representations is provided via integration with our group's [Anserini](http://anserini.io/) IR toolkit, which is built on Lucene.
Retrieval using dense representations is provided via integration with Facebook's [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) library.

Pyserini is primarily designed to provide effective, reproducible, and easy-to-use first-stage retrieval in a multi-stage ranking architecture.
Our toolkit is self-contained as a standard Python package and comes with queries, relevance judgments, [prebuilt indexes](docs/prebuilt-indexes.md), and evaluation scripts for many commonly used IR test collections.
With Pyserini, it's easy to reproduce runs on a number of standard IR test collections!

For additional details, [our paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3463238) in SIGIR 2021 provides a nice overview.

‚ú® **New!** Guide to working with the [MS MARCO 2.1 Document Corpus](docs/experiments-msmarco-v2.1.md) for TREC 2024 RAG Track.

‚ùó Anserini was upgraded from JDK 11 to JDK 21 at commit [`272565`](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/commit/39cecf6c257bae85f4e9f6ab02e0be101338c3cc) (2024/04/03), which corresponds to the release of v0.35.0.
Correspondingly, Pyserini was upgraded to JDK 21 at commit [`b2f677`](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/commit/b2f677da46e1910c0fd95e5ff06070bc71075401) (2024/04/04).

## üé¨ Installation

Install via PyPI:

```
pip install pyserini
```

Pyserini is built on Python 3.10 (other versions might work, but YMMV) and Java 21 (due to its dependency on [Anserini](http://anserini.io/)).
A `pip` installation will automatically pull in major dependencies such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [ü§ó Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), and the [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/).

The toolkit also has a number of optional dependencies:

```
pip install 'pyserini[optional]'
```

Notably, `faiss-cpu`, `lightgbm`, and `nmslib` are included in these optional dependencies.
Installation of these packages can be temperamental, which is why they are not included in the core dependencies.
It might be a good idea to install these yourself separately.

The software ecosystem is rapidly evolving and a potential source of frustration is incompatibility among different versions of underlying dependencies.
We provide additional detailed installation instructions [here](./docs/installation.md).

If you're planning on just _using_ Pyserini, then the `pip` instruction (without the optional dependencies) should be fine.
However, if you're planning on contributing to the codebase or want to work with the latest not-yet-released features, you'll need a development installation.
Instructions are provided [here](./docs/installation.md#development-installation).

## üôã How do I search?

Pyserini supports different types of retrieval models.
See [this guide](docs/usage-search.md) for details on how to search common corpora in IR and NLP research
(e.g., MS MARCO, NaturalQuestions, BEIR, etc.) using indexes that we have already built for you.
Here are direct links into the guide:

+ [Traditional lexical models](docs/usage-search.md#traditional-lexical-models) (e.g., BM25) using Lucene.
+ [Learned sparse retrieval models](docs/usage-search.md#learned-sparse-retrieval-models) (e.g., uniCOIL, SPLADE, etc.) using Lucene.
+ [Learned dense retrieval models](docs/usage-search.md#learned-dense-retrieval-models) (e.g., DPR, Contriever, BGE, etc.) using Lucene or Faiss.
+ [Hybrid retrieval models](docs/usage-search.md#hybrid-retrieval-models) (e.g., dense-sparse fusion).

Once you get the top-_k_ results, you'll actually want to fetch the document text...
See [this guide](docs/usage-fetch.md) for how.

## üôã How do I index my own corpus?

Well, it depends on what type of retrieval model you want to search with:

+ [Building a BM25 Index (Direct Java Implementation)](docs/usage-index.md#building-a-bm25-index-direct-java-implementation)
+ [Building a BM25 Index (Embeddable Python Implementation)](docs/usage-index.md#building-a-bm25-index-embeddable-python-implementation)
+ [Building a Sparse Vector Index](docs/usage-index.md#building-a-sparse-vector-index)
+ [Building a Dense Vector Index](docs/usage-index.md#building-a-dense-vector-index)

The steps are different for different classes of models:
[this guide](docs/usage-index.md) (same as the links above) describes the details.

## ‚öóÔ∏è Reproducibility

With Pyserini, it's easy to [reproduce](docs/reproducibility.md) runs on a number of standard IR test collections!
We provide a number of [prebuilt indexes](docs/prebuilt-indexes.md) that directly support reproducibility "out of the box".

In our [SIGIR 2022 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477495.3531749), we introduced "two-click reproductions" that allow anyone to reproduce experimental runs with only two clicks (i.e., copy and paste).
Documentation is organized into reproduction matrices for different corpora that provide a summary of different experimental conditions and query sets:

## üìúÔ∏è Historical Notes

‚ÅâÔ∏è **Lucene 8 to Lucene 9 Transition.**
In 2022, Pyserini underwent a transition from Lucene 8 to Lucene 9.
Most of the prebuilt indexes have been rebuilt using Lucene 9, but there are a few still based on Lucene 8.

More details:

+ [PyPI v0.17.1](https://pypi.org/project/pyserini/0.17.1/) (commit [`33c87c`](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/commit/33c87c982d543d65e0ba1b4c94ee865fd9a6040e), released 2022/08/13) is the last Pyserini release built on Lucene 8, based on [Anserini v0.14.4](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/releases/tag/anserini-0.14.4).
Thereafter, Anserini trunk was upgraded to Lucene 9.
+ [PyPI v0.18.0](https://pypi.org/project/pyserini/0.18.0/) (commit [`5fab14`](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/commit/5fab143f64ed067ecf619c7d83ecd846aa494fbe), released 2022/09/26) is built on [Anserini v0.15.0](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/releases/tag/anserini-0.15.0), using Lucene 9.
Thereafter, Pyserini trunk advanced to Lucene 9.

Explanations:

+ **What's the impact?**
Indexes built with Lucene 8 are not fully compatible with Lucene 9 code (see [Anserini #1952](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/issues/1952)).
The workaround is to disable consistent tie-breaking, which happens automatically if a Lucene 8 index is detected by Pyserini.
However, Lucene 9 code running on Lucene 8 indexes will give slightly different results than Lucene 8 code running on Lucene 8 indexes.
Note that Lucene 8 code is _not_ able to read indexes built with Lucene 9.

+ **Why is this necessary?**
Although disruptive, an upgrade to Lucene 9 is necessary to take advantage of Lucene's HNSW indexes, which will increase the capabilities of Pyserini and open up the design space of dense/sparse hybrids.

With v0.11.0.0 and before, Pyserini versions adopted the convention of _X.Y.Z.W_, where _X.Y.Z_ tracks the version of Anserini, and _W_ is used to distinguish different releases on the Python end.
Starting with Anserini v0.12.0, Anserini and Pyserini versions have become decoupled.

Anserini is designed to work with JDK 11.
There was a JRE path change above JDK 9 that breaks pyjnius 1.2.0, as documented in [this issue](https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius/issues/304), also reported in Anserini [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/issues/832) and [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/issues/805).
This issue was fixed with pyjnius 1.2.1 (released December 2019).
The previous error was documented in [this notebook](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-notebooks/blob/master/pyjnius_demo.ipynb) and [this notebook](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-notebooks/blob/master/pyjnius_demo_jvm_issue_fix.ipynb) documents the fix.
